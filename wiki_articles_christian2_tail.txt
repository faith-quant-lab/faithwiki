#Article: Unite the Right rally
#Type: regular article

The Unite the Right rally (also known as the Charlottesville rally) was a far-right rally which degenerated into violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, from August 11-12, 2017. Its stated goal was to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park, which itself had been renamed by City Council from  two months earlier. Protesters included white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, and various militias. Some of the marchers chanted racist and anti-semitic slogans, carried semi-automatic rifles, swastikas, Confederate battle flags, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic banners and "Trump/Pence" signs. 

The rally occurred amidst the backdrop of controversy generated by the  removal of Confederate monuments throughout the country in response to the Charleston church shooting in 2015. The event turned violent after protesters clashed with counterprotesters, leaving 14 injured. On the morning of August 12, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, stating that public safety could not be safeguarded without additional powers. Within an hour, the Virginia State Police declared the assembly to be unlawful. At around 1:45 p.m, a man linked to white-supremacist groups rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters about 0.5 mi away from the rally site, killing one person and injuring 19. Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the ramming as domestic terrorism, and authorities began a civil rights investigation to determine if the driver will be tried under hate crime statutes. 

In his initial statement on the rally, U.S. President Donald Trump did not denounce white nationalists by name, instead blaming "hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides." His statement and his subsequent defenses of it were criticized as implying moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested against white supremacy, with critics interpreting it as a sign that he was sympathetic to the white supremacists.

#Subtitle level 2: Background

In the wake of the 2015 Charleston Church shooting, efforts were made across the country to remove Confederate monuments from public spaces and rename streets honoring notable figures from the Confederacy. While often successful, those efforts often faced a backlash from conservatives or people concerned about protecting their Confederate heritage.  The August 11-12 rally was organized to protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue honoring the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia, which had been renamed from Lee Park in June 2016. The event was organized by white nationalists, white supremacists, and the alt-right. 

One organizer, Jason Kessler, also cited the renaming as a reason for the rally. Another organizer, Nathan Damigo, said the rally was intended to unify white nationalist factions.

#Subtitle level 3: Summer rallies in Charlottesville

On May 13, 2017, white supremacist Richard Spencer led the 'Take-Back Lee Park' rally, a protest in Charlottesville against the city's plans to remove the statue of Lee. The event involved protesters holding torches near the statue. That same night, a candlelight counterprotest took place.

The Ku Klux Klan held another rally in Charlottesville on July 8. About 50 Klan members and 1,000 counterprotesters gathered at a loud but nonviolent rally; the Klan members left the park after about 45 minutes. In opposition to the rally, the Charlottesville Clergy Collective created a safe space at First United Methodist Church, which was used by over 600 people.

#Subtitle level 3: Protesters

Among the far-right groups engaged in organizing the march were the clubs of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, The Right Stuff, the National Policy Institute, and four groups that form the Nationalist Front: the neo-Confederate League of the South, the Traditionalist Workers Party, Vanguard America, and the National Socialist Movement. Other groups involved in the rally were the Ku Klux Klan, the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, the 3 Percenters, Identity Evropa, the Oath Keepers, the American Guard, the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia, the New York Light Foot Militia, the Virginia Minutemen Militia, the Detroit Right Wings, the Rise Above Movement, True Cascadia, and Anti-Communist Action. 

Prominent far-right figures in attendance included National Policy Institute Chairman Richard Spencer, entertainer Baked Alaska, former Libertarian Party candidate Augustus Invictus, former Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke, Identity Evropa leader Nathan Damigo, Traditionalist Youth Network CEO Matthew Heimbach, Rebel Media journalist Faith Goldy, Right Stuff founder Mike Enoch, League of the South founder Michael Hill, Red Ice host Henrik Palmgren, Right Side Broadcasting Network host Nicholas Fuentes, YouTube personality James Allsup, AltRight.com editor Daniel Friberg, former Business Insider CTO Pax Dickinson, Right Stuff blogger Johnny Monoxide, Daily Stormer writer Robert "Azzmador" Ray, Daily Caller contributor and rally organizer Jason Kessler, and Radical Agenda host Christopher Cantwell. Gavin McInnes, the leader of the self-described "Western chauvinist" Proud Boys group, was invited to attend but declined because of an unwillingness "to be associated with explicit neo-Nazis." In June, ahead of the rally, McInnes declared that "we need to distance ourselves from them," but "after backlash to the original disavowal flared-up from Alt-Right circles, the statement was withdrawn and replaced with another distancing the Proud Boys from the event yet also encouraging those who 'feel compelled' to attend."

Airbnb cancelled a number of bookings and accounts when it learned that they were being used by attendees at the rally, citing a request that users endorse a commitment to "accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age."

#Subtitle level 3: Counterprotestors

Those who marched in opposition to the rally were unified in opposition to white supremacy, but "espoused a wide array of ideological beliefs, preferred tactics and political goals. A large number were ordinary residents of Charlottesville who wanted to show their disdain for white supremacist groups, particularly after the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the city on July 8." Ahead of the rally, an array of "faith-based groups, civil rights organizations, local businesses, and faculty and students at the University of Virginia" planned counterprotests. In July 2017, the ecumenical and interfaith clergy group Congregate Charlottesville called for a thousand members of the clergy to counterprotest at the rally. Groups counterprotesting included representatives from the National Council of Churches, Black Lives Matter, Anti-Racist Action, Antifa, the Democratic Socialists of America, the Workers World Party, the Revolutionary Communist Party, Redneck Revolt, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council, and Showing Up for Racial Justice.

#Subtitle level 3: University and city preparations

The rally occurred when the University of Virginia was between its summer and fall terms. On August 4, University of Virginia (UVA) President Teresa Sullivan sent an e-mail to students and faculty, which said, "I urge students and all UVA community members to avoid the August 12 rally and avoid physical confrontation generally. There is a credible risk of violence at this event, and your safety is my foremost concern." The University of Virginia Medical Center canceled all elective surgeries and preemptively activated its emergency response plan.

Fearing possible violence, the Virginia Discovery Museum and many downtown businesses closed for the day of the rally.

#Subtitle level 3: Permits and court case

Jason Kessler, one of the organizers of the rally, applied for a permit from the City of Charlottesville to hold the event at Emancipation Park. The week before the event, the Charlottesville governmentâ€”including Mayor Michael Signer, city council, City Manager Maurice Jones, and Police Chief Al Thomasâ€”said they would approve the permit only if the event was moved to the larger McIntire Park.  The city's leaders cited safety concerns and logistical issues associated with holding the event at Emancipation Park, adjacent to the densely populated Downtown Mall. Kessler refused to agree to relocate the rally, but the City relocated the rally anyway, a decision praised by the Downtown Business Association of Charlottesville.

Kessler, supported by the Rutherford Institute and the ACLU, sued the City of Charlottesville and Jones on First Amendment grounds in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. On the evening of August 11, the night before the rally, Judge Glen E. Conrad granted an emergency injunction declaring that the Unite the Right rally could go forward.  Conrad granted the injunction for the rally citing several factors: that Emancipation Park was the location for the statue of Robert E. Lee that was planned to be taken down and that the rally was partially for, that resources would be needed at both parks for both the rally and the counterprotesters, and that the move to McIntire Park was due to the viewpoints of the organizer and not the safety of the public. The court's decision was praised by the ACLU. Mayor Signer issued a statement saying: "While the City is disappointed by tonight's ruling, we will abide by the judge's decision. ... Chief Thomas, his team and the hundreds of law enforcement officials in our City will now turn their full attention to protecting the Downtown area during tomorrow's events."

Prior to the rally, counterprotesters obtained permit(s) to gather at McGuffey Park and Justice Park, both less than a quarter-mile distant from the Emancipation Park rally. Charlottesville City Council spokeswoman Miriam I. Dickler later stated that counterprotesters did not need permits to protest the rally at Emancipation Park.

#Subtitle level 3: August 11

Tensions increased on the evening of Friday, August 11 when a group of white nationalistsâ€”variously numbered at dozens or around 100â€”marched through the University of Virginia's campus from Nameless Field to The Lawn. The group was primarily composed of white men, many carrying tiki torches.  

While marching, the group chanted Nazi and white supremacist slogans including "White lives matter"; "Blood and Soil"; "you will not replace us"; and "Jews will not replace us."

At the Rotunda, the group encountered counterprotesters next to a statue of Thomas Jefferson. The white nationalists encircled the smaller group of counterprotesters at the base of the statue, and a brawl ensued. Several people on both sides were reportedly hit with pepper spray, and several people were treated for minor injuries. The white nationalists began swinging and throwing their lit tiki torches amid the chaos. Virginia State Police came to break up the brawl.

Meanwhile, clergy led a pre-planned ecumenical Christian and interfaith prayer service at St. Paul's Memorial Church on University Avenue in opposition to the Unite the Right rally.

The Cavalier Daily reported, "While waiting for rides at Nameless Field after the march, several of the 'alt-right' protesters hurled anti-Semitic, homophobic and misogynistic slurs at several reporters and community members asking them questions. One man asking questions was thrown to the ground and surrounded by marchers after a brief physical altercation." Mayor Michael Signer condemned the gathering, writing the following: "When I think of candlelight, I want to think of prayer vigils. Today, in 2017, we are instead seeing a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march."

#Subtitle level 3: August 12

Protesters and counterprotesters gathered at Emancipation Park in anticipation of the rally. White nationalist protesters again chanted white supemacist and Nazi-era slogans 

Some waved Confederate flags, and others held posters targeting Jews that read "the Goyim know", using the word for non-Jews, as well as "the Jewish media is going down". Protesters also shouted racial slurs and "Jew" when Charlottesville mayor Michael Signer was mentioned, and they waved Nazi flags and signs claiming, among other things, that "Jews are Satan's children". Dozens wore Donald Trump's red "Make America Great Again" campaign hats.

Counterprotests began with an interfaith, interracial group of clergy who linked arms, prayed, and sang songs of peace such as This Little Light of Mine. The small group was surrounded by neo-Fascists; public intellectual Cornel West later averred that "we would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists who approached, over 300, 350 anti-fascists. We just had 20," given that the police had pulled back, and was certain that their lives had been saved. Later in the day, counterprotesters chanted slogans including "Kill All Nazis" and "punch a Nazi in the mouth."The armed leftist group Redneck Revolt posted on their website: "To the fascists and all who stand with them, we'll be seeing you in Virginia."

Virginia allows the open carrying of firearms under state law; many white nationalists, as well as some counterprotesters, carried semi-automatic weapons. 

Beginning in the morning, ahead of the rally's official noon start time, "protesters and counterprotesters faced off, kicking, punching, hurling water bottles at and deploying chemical sprays against one another." 

The AP reported that "people threw punches, screamed, set off smoke bombs, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Others darted around, trying to avoid the chaos." An estimated 500 protesters and more than a thousand counterprotesters were on the site. At least 14 people were injured in street brawls.

At 11:00 a.m., the City of Charlottesville declared a state of emergency, citing an "imminent threat of civil disturbance, unrest, potential injury to persons, and destruction of public and personal property". One hour later, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, stating: "It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly-out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property. I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state."

At about 11:40 a.m., shortly before the rally was scheduled to begin, Virginia State Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly via megaphones, and riot police cleared the scene. Following this, "a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters" moved to McIntire Park about 2 mi away, where they gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the "Unite the Right" event.

#Subtitle level 4: Vehicular attack and homicide

After the aborted rally, at around 1:45 p.m., a man drove his car toward a crowd of counterprotestors, hitting several and slamming into a stopped sedan, which hit a stopped minivan that was in front of it. The impact of the crash pushed the sedan and the minivan further into the crowd. One person was killed and 19 others were injured in what police have called a deliberate attack. The man then reversed the car through the crowd and fled the scene. 

The ramming occurred at a pedestrian mall at Water and Fourth streets, about four blocks away from Emancipation Park (). Heather D. Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal from Charlottesville, was pronounced dead at the University of Virginia's University Hospital.

Video footage recorded at the scene showed a gray 2010 Dodge Challenger accelerating towards crowds on a pedestrian mall, hitting people and sending them airborne, then reversing at high speed, hitting more people. The moment when the car was driven into the crowd was captured on video by bystanders and in aerial video footage taken by a drone. A photographer present at the scene said the car "plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming." Bystanders said it was "definitely a violent attack", according to The Guardian. Of the 19 injured survivors, the University of Virginia Medical Center reported that five were initially in critical condition. 

By the afternoon of August 14, ten patients had been discharged from the hospital, and the nine remaining patients were in good condition. Shortly after the collision, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old from Ohio who reportedly had expressed sympathy for Nazi Germany during his time as a student at Cooper High School in Union, Kentucky, was arrested. He was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and failure to stop following an accident resulting in death and held without bail. On August 18, Fields was charged with three counts of aggravated malicious wounding and two additional counts of malicious wounding.

Fields was photographed taking part in the rally, holding a shield emblazoned with the logo of Vanguard America, a white supremacist organization. Vanguard America's leaders later stated he was not a member and that "The shields seen do not denote membership" as they were "freely handed out to anyone in attendance." On August 14, Fields was again denied bail. He is being held at the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail.

National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and several U.S. senators described the alleged ramming as an act of domestic terrorism, as did various commentators. Late on the night of August 12, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the U.S. Department of Justice would open a civil rights investigation into the incident; federal investigators are investigating whether the suspect "crossed state lines with the intent to commit violence". Later, Sessions said the ramming meets the definition of 'domestic terrorism' and that it was "an unacceptable, evil attack."

Heyer's mother said she wanted Heather's name to become "a rallying cry for justice and equality and fairness and compassion."  Heyer's memorial service was held at Charlottesville's Paramount Theatre on August 16; Heyer's mother spoke to hundreds of mourners, asking them to honor Heyer by acting against injustice and turning "anger into righteous action."

Separate GoFundMe pages were set up for the Heyer family and for those injured in the crash; the latter was organized by the Anchorage co-chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America. The UVA Health Foundation created a fund for medical expenses of "patients at UVA Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital who were injured and impacted by this unwanted violence in our community."

Two motorists injured in the vehicle incident have sued the organizers of the event and the driver.

#Subtitle level 4: Fatal helicopter crash

At around 4:40 p.m. on August 12, a Bell 407 helicopter owned by the Virginia State Police crashed 7 mi southwest of Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport, killing two Virginia state troopers who were on board. Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M. M. Bates, 40, of Quinton, Virginia, were on the way to assist with security and public safety in the city. The crash is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and Virginia State Police.

#Subtitle level 2: Aftermath and reactions

#Subtitle level 3: Police handling of rally

In the aftermath of the rally and the car ramming, some criticized the police handling of the rally. Claire GastaÃ±aga, executive director of the Virginia ACLU, wrote that "The situation that occurred was preventable" and the ACLU's lawsuit, which resulted in a federal court granting an injunction allowing the rally to go forward at Emancipation Park, "did not cause it." GastaÃ±aga wrote that: "The lack of any physical separation of the protesters and counterprotesters on the street was contributing to the potential of violence. Police did not respond. In fact, law enforcement was standing passively by, waiting for violence to take place, so that they would have grounds to declare an emergency, declare an 'unlawful assembly' and clear the area."

On August 12, investigative news organization ProPublica published an article reporting that Virginia State Police troopers and Charlottesville police "wearing protective gear watched silently from behind an array of metal barricades" and allowed "white supremacists and counterprotesters to physically battle" without intervening. A. C. Thompson wrote that in "one of countless such confrontations," police watched passively as "an angry mob of white supremacists formed a battle line across from a group of counterprotesters, many of them older and gray-haired, who had gathered near a church parking lot. On command from their leader, the young men charged and pummeled their ideological foes with abandon. One woman was hurled to the pavement, and the blood from her bruised head was instantly visible." Many white supremacists came armed, wearing helmets and carrying "clubs, medieval-looking round wooden shields, and rectangular plexiglass shields." Some counterprotesters also brought sticks, helmets and shields to the rally.

Virginia officials defended the police actions. Governor Terry McAuliffe said police did a "magnificent job" and, "We were unfortunately sued by the ACLU, and the judge ruled against us. That rally should not have been in the middle of downtown: to disperse all those people from the park where they dispersed all over the city streets and it became a powder keg. We have to do a better job working with the judiciary. They need to listen to local city officials . ... I am angry that this was not moved to McIntire Park where the city of Charlottesville requested." 

Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said that while he had "regrets" about planning, police officers had attempted to separate protesters and counterprotesters but were unable to effectively do so, in part because "Unite the Right" participants had failed to follow a previously agreed-upon plan for entering Emancipation Park: "We had a plan to bring them in at the rear of the park. They had agreed to cooperate with the plan; unfortunately they did not follow the plan. They began entering at different locations in and around the park." Thomas also wrote: "They also chose to leave the park on a number of occasions, entering the area designated for counterprotesters, walking along the street and confronting counter-protestors." Thomas denied the implications by the Virginia ACLU that police were ordered not to intervene or make arrests, saying "There were no directives from me or any other commander to stand down or disengage" and that "there were a number of altercations throughout the area in which officers intervened."

#Subtitle level 3: Vigils and protests

On August 13, the day following the rally, many groups organized vigils and demonstrations in a number of cities across the country with a variety of goals, including showing support for those against white supremacy, pushing for the removal of Confederate monuments, and denouncing fascism and actions and statements by the president of the United States. 

In Brooklyn, demonstrators at the "Peace and Sanity" rally heard addresses by Public Advocate Letitia James and City Comptroller Scott Stringer. In Los Angeles, hundreds gathered on the steps of City Hall to condemn white-nationalist violence and honor those killed.

Thousands of anti-Trump protesters marched around Trump Tower, with many shouting "Shame, shame, shame!" and "Lock Him Up!". In response, pro-Trump counterprotesters waved American flags and yelled "Make America White Again" at protesters. One man gave a Nazi salute to the passing presidential motorcade.Confrontations at the park continued on Tuesday, August 15, with counterprotestors demanding that a North Carolina man in Confederate uniform holding a Confederate flag and semi-automatic rifle leave the park. When police asked him if he would like to leave, he said he would and was escorted to his vehicle.

#Subtitle level 3: Organizers' responses

On the afternoon of August 13, Unite the Right organizer Jason Kessler attempted to hold a press conference in front of Charlottesville City Hall, but was forced to abandon the conference after being attacked by an angry crowd. One man reportedly either punched or attempted to punch Kessler, and a woman tackled Kessler as he was trying to leave the scene. Police came to Kessler's aid and escorted him from the area. Hundreds of people shouted "shame" at Kessler and "say her name" (referring to Heather Heyer, the woman killed the day before). Before ending the short news conference Kessler stated â€œI disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic." He later posted videos online in which he blamed the city for the violence and death. One man was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery for allegedly spitting on Kessler during the news conference.

Speaking in an interview on the day of the rally, David Duke called the protests "a turning point for the people of this country. We are determined to take our country back. We're going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump." Following President Trumps initial comments made three days after the rally, Duke reportedly tweeted, "Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."

Richard B. Spencer, who was scheduled to speak at the Unite the Right event, said he was not responsible for the violence, and he blamed counterprotesters and police.

#Subtitle level 3: Online responses

Domain registrar GoDaddy demanded that The Daily Stormer move its website's domain to another provider after editor Andrew Anglin described the car-ramming victim in derogatory terms. The Daily Stormer then moved to Google Domains on August 14. Google canceled the site's registration for violation of its terms of service just over 3 hours after The Daily Stormer registered for the service.

PayPal suspended accounts of the right-wing extremist groups run by several of the rally organizers for violating the website's terms of service, which forbid raising money for "activities that promote hate, violence or racial intolerance".

Hacktivist collective Anonymous shut down numerous websites associated with the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups following the protests. Alt-right website Red Ice TV was also hacked. In a video statement, they claimed that their coverage and support of the rally was the cause of the cyberattack. A Discord server frequented by alt-right elements was also taken down.

Before the suspect in the vehicular ramming on August 12 was revealed, there was an online campaign to identify the driver of the car used, during which a group of users incorrectly identified Joel Vangheluwe as the driver. The car used had previously belonged to Vangheluwe's father, Jerome Vangheluwe, but the car was no longer in the family's possession. After far-right news website GotNews reported that Vangheluwe was the driver, the family received numerous death threats and were advised to flee their home by local police. The family has hired a lawyer and plans to sue GotNews and other publications that published the false accusations.

On Twitter, a group of users identified white nationalist or supremacist marchers from photographs, publicizing at least nine names and identities. After being identified as a demonstrator at the rally, one individual resigned from his job at a hot dog stand in Berkeley, California. There was at least one reported case of mistaken identity; a University of Arkansas engineering professor received threatening messages from Twitter users who mistook him for a similar-looking man at the rally who wore an "Arkansas Engineering" T-shirt.

A short film produced by the United States War Department in 1943 entitled Don't Be a Sucker!, which contains anti-racist and anti-fascist themes, "found a new audience" and became a viral online video.

A logo by artist Mike Mitchell, featuring the number 45 (referring to Trump being the 45th President of the United States) rendered like a Nazi swastika behind the No symbol, took off after the Charlottesville riots, used by anti-Trump activists on social media and at protests calling for his removal. The logo, which was originally created that February, was brought to attention after Keith Olbermann retweeted Mitchell's original post.

#Subtitle level 3: Political responses

Before the rally, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine expressed support for free speech, but he condemned the rally.

In an address later in the day following the rally, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, flanked by Charlottesville mayor Michael Signer, and Charlottesville's police chief, directly addressed the rally participants: "I have a message to all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today. Our message is plain and simple. Go home ... You are not wanted in this great commonwealth." Signer said he was disgusted that white supremacists came to his town and he faulted President Donald Trump for inflaming racial tensions during his 2016 campaign, stating: "I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president."

University of Virginia Center for Politics director Larry J. Sabato, who lives on the university grounds and saw the march on August 11, said that the weekend was among the university's darkest days, stating: "I hope people will put it into context and understand that we had no control over the individuals organizing it, nor the people who showed up. What we can control is our personal and institutional reaction to it. What I saw was pure evil."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the violence "horrifying" and "evil" and said: "It is racist, far-right violence and clear, forceful action must be taken against it, regardless of where in the world it happens." German Justice Minister Heiko Maas similarly condemned the violence, antisemitism, and racism of the neo-Nazis at the rally. 

White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon in his interview with Robert Kuttner, called the far-right as "irrelevant" after Kuttner asked him about the "ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trumpâ€™s reluctance to condemn it." He quoted Bannon as saying, "Ethno-nationalism - itâ€™s losers. Itâ€™s a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more â€ These guys are a collection of clowns."

#Subtitle level 4: President Trump's statements

#Subtitle level 5: First statement

On August 12, Trump spoke on camera from his vacation home in New Jersey, saying "We all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Let's come together as one!" He said, "we condem in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides." He added, "What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order."

A spokesperson for Trump later released an addendum to his remarks, stating, "The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together." (The statement was re-released after an initial draft released to media outlets such as CNN which the typo was noted by Brian Stelter, misspelled "neo-nazi" as "nephew-nazi".)

Trump's "many sides" comment was criticized as insufficient by some members of Congress, from both the Democratic and Republican parties. 

Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump "was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'". The decision was reported to have come from White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

The Congressional Black Caucus decried what it saw as Trump's false equivalency and dog-whistle politics, saying "White supremacy is to blame." Republican U.S. Representative Justin Amash and Senators Cory Gardner, Jeff Flake, Orrin Hatch, and Marco Rubio all called upon Trump to specifically condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis; in a tweet that was retweeted by Flake, Gardner said: "Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism." Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said: "The violence, chaos, and apparent loss of life in Charlottesville is not the fault of 'many sides.' It is racists and white supremacists." Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), whose brother was killed in action in Europe during World War II, tweeted, "We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home." 

Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) called it "domestic terrorism" in a tweet, and a few hours later Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote on Facebook, "The Nazis, the KKK, and white supremacists are repulsive and evil, and all of us have a moral obligation to speak out against the lies, bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred that they propagate ... Having watched the horrifying video of the car deliberately crashing into a crowd of protesters, I urge the Department of Justice to immediately investigate and prosecute this grotesque act of domestic terrorism."

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke responded by saying that Trump should "take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists". Other white supremacists and neo-Nazis did not object to Trump's remarks. Daily Stormer editor Andrew Anglin said "Trump did the opposite of cuck. He refused to even mention anything to do with us. When reporters were screaming at him about White Nationalism he just walked out of the room."

The NAACP released a statement saying that while they "acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today", they call on Trump "to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon - a well-known white supremacist leader - from his team of advisers". The statement further describes Bannon as a "symbol of white nationalism" who "energizes that sentiment" through his current position within the White House. 

Political scientist Larry Sabato, playwright Beau Willimon, conservative journalist David A. French, Democratic U.S. Representative Ted Lieu and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also called for Bannon's firing. Two former federal government lawyers, Vanita Gupta and Richard Painter, who worked in the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, called for both Bannon and Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka to be fired. 

Bannon was fired on August 18, on the heels of an American Prospect interview, in which he mockingly downplayed Trump's threats of military action on North Korea, and put down his administration colleagues and the far-right, which White House aides felt would likely provoke Trump; two unnamed administration officials claimed that Trump had informed senior aides of his decision to remove Bannon that day, while a personal colleague of Bannon's claimed that Bannon submitted his resignation on August 7, with the announcement (which was to have occurred earlier that week) being delayed in the wake of the Charlottesville rally.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus and U.S. Representative Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) called on Trump to fire Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller in addition to Bannon and Gorka, because of Miller's alleged white nationalist ties.

#Subtitle level 5: Second statement

On August 14, from the White House, President Trump said: To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered. ...Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. left 

Trump had reportedly been reluctant to issue this statement, believing that his initial statement was adequate, but he was persuaded to speak again by White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly.

Richard B. Spencer dismissed Trump's second statement as "hollow" and he also said that he believed that Trump had not denounced either the alt-right movement or white nationalism. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott (one of three African Americans serving in the U.S. Senate, and the only Republican among the three), also said the second statement came too late; The Los Angeles Timess editorial board wrote that "Trump's first response to Charlottesville was tepid and mealy mouthed. His second was too late." 

NAACP president Cornell William Brooks said Trump's second statement stuck to a "rhetorical minimum" of a condemnation, and "gave the impression that the President was trying to have his hate cake and eat it too".

Trump later tweeted "Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!"

#Subtitle level 5: Third statement

On August 15, Trump appeared before the media from his home at Trump Tower in New York City, to give prepared remarks about the state of the U.S. infrastructure and other economic issues. After reading his prepared statement, Trump took question from the media who asked questions mostly about the Charlottesville events. Trump defended his August 12 statement and repeated his claim that there was "blame on both sides." He also defended White House advisor Steve Bannon, and accused the media of unfair treatment of the rallyâ€²s participants. Trump said: "Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch." Trump said that the push to remove Confederate statues was an attempt to â€³change historyâ€. Trump also said that there were "very fine people on both sides". Trump criticized what he called the "very, very violent ... alt-left". 

In an interview published the next day, Bannon said the press conference was as a "defining moment" and that Trump chose to jettison the "globalists" and align himself with "his people. He said he was "proud of how Trump stood up to the braying mob of reporters."

According to Princeton University historian Kevin M. Kruse, there is a historical "false equivalency" precedent to blaming "both sides" in disputes over race relations. Kruse notes that segregationist politicians often equated white supremacists with the civil rights movement, condemning both the KKK and the NAACP. Various historians also questioned Trump's suggestion that the individuals calling for the removal of Confederate monuments would next demand the removal of figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Harvard historian Annette Gordon-Reed and others noted that Washington and Jefferson were imperfect men who are notable for creating the United States, whereas the sole historical significance of Confederate figures such as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis is that they went to war against the United States to defend "the right of people to own other people." 

Other historians noted that some wanted the Confederate monuments moved to museums where the monuments could be appropriately contextualized. Douglas A. Blackmon, senior fellow at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs and author of a book on slavery and its aftermath in the U.S. told The Washington Post: "Trump either does not understand the history of the Confederacy or he's sympathetic to white nationalist views. ... These statues are offensive to millions of citizens that he governs. â€ When you reach a point that there are hate groups that engage in terrorist attacks, that these statues are being appropriated and used in that way â€ simply take them down." 

Carol Swain, a former political science professor at Vanderbilt University, presented an opposing viewpoint: "Just coming out and denouncing white supremacy, and painting everyone with the same broad brush, does not solve the problem. There are black nationalists, there are white nationalists, there are Hispanic nationalists, and so we canâ€™t say itâ€™s just one group. So the president was correct when he said that there were many forces involved. Had the counter-protesters not been there, maybe the entire rally would have ended differently.

More than 60 Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate condemned Trump's remarks. Among those were Senators Bernie Sanders, John McCain, Tim Scott, Susan Collins, Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Flake, Orrin Hatch, Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill, Dean Heller and Tammy Duckworth, and House members Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, Don Beyer, Barbara Comstock, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Will Hurd and Gerry Connolly, as well as Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, "The president's continued talk of blame 'on many sides' ignores the abhorrent evil of white supremacism..." Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated, "We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity." 

Former presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush stated that, "America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms. As we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country."

On August 16, Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, Pramila Jayapal of Washington State and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey unveiled a resolution that the three House Democrats co-authored, which would censure Trump for his "inadequate response to the violence", his "failure to immediately and specifically name and condemn the white supremacist groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism," and for employing chief strategist Steve Bannon and national security aide Sebastian Gorka despite their â€œties to white supremacist movements.â€ 

Criticism of the comments also extended to the corporate world; among others, 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch said in a email to friends that was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, "What we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the president of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people. These events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation â€ a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals" (Murdoch also pledged a $1 million donation to the Anti-Defamation League, urging his friends to also make contributions).

Additional controversy resulted from a Facebook post by Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal in which she commented, "I hope Trump is assassinated!," in response to the president's comments. In apologizing for the remark, Chapple-Nadal said to The Kansas City Star that she posted the comment in frustration of the "trauma and despair" of Trump's statements about the Charlottesville rally. 

The post, which she deleted shortly after posting it but not before it was circulated online, led several state and national politicians, including U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill and House Representative Lacy Clay, to call for her resignation; State Rep. Joshua Peters also submitted a letter to State Senate President pro tempore Tom Dempsey (chairman of the Missouri Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions and Ethics Committee) requesting that a special committee consider Chappelle-Nadal's "censure or removal" from office.

The fallout from the third statement also led to renewed calls for Trump to resign or be removed from office through either impeachment or through invocation of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. In an August 15 Twitter post, Democratic House Representative Jackie Speier of California suggested that the never-before-used article of the 25th Amendment (which allows the vice president and either a majority of the cabinet or another body such as Congress to declare that a president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office) be invoked to remove Trump. Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee announced on August 17, that he would introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump for his remarks in the press conference, stating that Trump had â€œfailed the presidential test of moral leadership.â€ Arnold Schwarzenegger made an online video criticizing Trump's statement and presented a speech condemning the racists and stating Trump should've said something like that.

In an August 18 interview with ABC's Good Morning America, Heather Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, stated that she has not "and now.. will not" meet with President Trump after hearing about his statement. Bro said, "I'm not talking to the president now. I'm sorry, after what he said about my child. It's not that I saw somebody else's tweets about him. I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protesters, like Ms. Heyer, with the KKK and the white supremacists."

The fallout from this statement also led to renewed calls for Trump's removal from the WWE Hall of Fame. Additionally, a petition to strip Trump of an honorary law degree from Lehigh University by a recent graduate went viral following his comments, gaining over 15,000 signatures. Trump was previously stripped of an honorary degree from Scotland's Robert Gordon University in 2015. If he loses his degree from Lehigh, Trump will only have three honorary degrees remaining; two from Liberty University and one from Wagner College.

#Subtitle level 4: Resignations from and dissolution of presidential advisory councils

Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck, resigned from the President's American Manufacturing Council on August 14, in reaction to the President's response to the rally. Trump quickly responded by attacking Frazier on Twitter. Frazier received widespread support from major figures in politics, media and business, and several commentators noted that it took Trump only minutes to condemn Frazier, but it took him several days to denounce the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville. Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank and Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich also resigned from the council that same day, followed by the resignations of AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, economist and former AFL-CIO deputy chief of staff Thea Lee, and Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul on August 15.  The following morning, two more CEOs - Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup and Inge Thulin of 3M - announced that they would resign from American Manufacturing Council. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon also directly criticized Trump's leadership, saying Trump "missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together."

On August 16, after the members of the advisory councils moved to disband, Trump dissolved both councils. Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Anat R. Admati said that Trump's equivocations on white nationalist groups had "put them in a very difficult position" and caused critical damage to the president's relationship with corporate leaders.

On August 18, 16 of the 17 members of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities resigned in protest of Trump's response to the rally. The resigning members stated in a letter to the President, "Reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans in Charlottesville." Representatives for the sole remaining member, film director George C. Wolfe, stated that he, too, would be resigning and would add his name to the letter. The White House responded with a statement reading in part, "Earlier this month it was decided that President Trump will not renew the Executive Order for the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH), which expires later this year."

#Subtitle level 3: Religious responses

The General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, Olav Fykse Tveit, stated that "Terror and violence against peaceful people seeking justice in Charlottesville must be condemned by all...We are proud of moral leadership by clergy and lay people standing against this promotion of racism and white supremacy."

The United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the Orthodox Church in America, all of which are members of the World Council of Churches, each individually condemned the Unite the Right rally and the racist ideology behind it, as did The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Catholic Church.

The Rabbinical Council of America, the leading organization of orthodox rabbis in North America, strongly condemned the violence and bigotry displayed at the demonstration

#Subtitle level 3: Statue removals

Following the violence in Charlottesville, Confederate statues were removed from several locations across the United States. In Baltimore, the city's four Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15-16; Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she had ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety. 

In Durham, North Carolina, several protesters toppled a statue outside the Old Durham County Courthouse; four activists were arrested in connection with the toppling. In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse.

A plaque in Montreal that was installed in a Hudson's Bay Company store commemorating Jefferson Davis's brief stay in the city by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1957 was removed following the rally, after many citizens complained.

#Article: Death in Rome
#Type: regular article

Death in Rome (Der Tod in Rom: Roman) is a 1954 German novel by Wolfgang Koeppen, who belonged to the literary generation of West Germany which had to revive the devastated cultural landscape after twelve years of the "brown plague" and the ruin of the war, and, was one of the first artists to embroider the new social and political realities of the country when the wave of chauvinistic and revanchist psychosis broke out. An exploration of themes associated with the Holocaust, German guilt, conflict between generations, and, the silencing of the past, it is, after  (Tauben im Gras: Roman, 1951, which recreates a typical day in Munich in 1948) and  (Das Treibhaus: Roman, 1953, which deals with the corruption of the Bonn government), the third work of the so-called Trilogy of Failure (Trilogie des Scheiterns), about postwar life in West Germany, with which Koeppen established himself as an important figure in German post-war literature. It opens with a quotation from Dante Alighieri's Inferno: Il mal seme d'Adamo, followed by the last sentence from Death in Venice: Und noch desselben Tages empfing eine respektvoll erschÃ¼tterte Welt die Nachricht von seinem Tode.

#Subtitle level 2: Synopsis

The novel, which contains the worst accusations against German militarism, and, reveals the dangerous influence of fascist ideology on certain social strata in West Germany, warns and prophesies. It deals with the careers of former National Socialists after World War II. Against the backdrop of Rome, which assumes the function of a metaphor and at the same time is a specific decor of the events described, as, its ancient monuments predispose to reflection on the fate of the world, the nature of good and evil, war and peace, past and future, wealth and poverty, and, justice and social oppression, victims and perpetrators from the time of National Socialism meet during the post-war period. In a kind of literary choreography, the author composes new groups of figures from the members of two families and their surrounding environment in several parallel lines of action. In an artistic network of dialogues and inner monologues, the present is problematized and the past uncovered. The characters show the opportunism and the adaptability of the followers, as well as the unbroken violence of the perpetrators, like the torn-upness and escapism of the next generation. The background is the still unsolved problem of overcoming the National Socialist past in the time of the Wirtschaftswunder. The novel has a peculiar connection with Thomas Mann's Death in Venice (Der Tod in Venedig: Novelle, 1912), most notably by addressing the problems of artistic creativity against the background of moral decay. Stylistically, Death in Rome is similar to the other two novels of Wolfgang Koeppen. Here, too, the writer manifests himself as the master of the metaphorically rich, richly associative prose. Koeppen uses, with great skill, the stylistic means of cinema - the installation, the constant change of view and the distance to the depicted event, and, the simultaneous performance of the action. The epic narrative is coupled with the internal monologue of the characters, which, according to the writer, "best suits our perception, our consciousness, and, our bitter experience." The author presents himself with his novel Death in Rome as a politically- and socially-engaged writer. In his speech, given in 1962, when he received the Georg BÃ¼chner Prize, he stated: "I saw the poet, the writer of those who were rejected by the public, I saw him as suffering and sympathetic to the alien grief. Later, I heard about engaging literature, and, it struck me that something of a self-worth, something like breathing, wants to make an artistic stance or a fashion." He never advocated a certain ideology or political program. His works are the words he puts in the mouth of one of the heroes of the novel Death in Rome: "I ask questions, yet, I do not know the answer, I cannot answer." Koeppen called his works "a monologue attempt against the world." However, by virtue of a particular paradox, his protest against existence is also a plea for new, more humane form of life. It for this reason that he was called, by Alfred Andersch, a "humanistic pessimist." And this hidden humanistic pathos outside the resignation inspires a lasting literary life, and, the novel Death in Rome. Koeppen said of his novel: "We all live with politics, we are all its subjects or even victims of it. How can the writer behave like the ostrich, and, who, if not the writer, must take on the role of Cassandra in our society?"

#Subtitle level 2: Characters

One of the main characters is a Nazi criminal, General Gottlieb Judejahn of the Schutzstaffel and the Freikorps. He was sentenced in absentia to death at the Nuremberg trials, yet, has escaped retribution. He is a professional executioner, he embodies all the misdeeds, the whole barbarity of fascism. Judejahn is still convinced that he did the right thing by killing and destroying people. With sadistic delight, he recalls the images of his victims in memory - in these memories he finds refuge when he is unhappy with his present life. Judejahn believes he is a hero, bearer of all German virtues, the embodiment of the duty fulfilled to the "deity of power" Adolf Hitler. He escaped to an Arab country whose military he is trying to build up in order to defeat Israel. He is in Rome to buy weapons and to meet members of his family, including his wife, Eva. His wife, Eva, is portrayed as some "Nordic Erinye," dreaming of the revival of the Third Reich, the triumph of the "millennial empire," and, the German domination over the world. Even her husband, whom she blindly worshiped, prefers to socialize with the "fallen heroes," with the "martyrs" of Nazism, not with the survivors, however, they have lost their power and majesty. The meeting between the two husbands, between the two Nazi monsters, was conveyed by the writer with extraordinary power and artistic impetus. 

Their son, Adolf, has replaced the SS with the cassock. With the collapse of the fascist myth, he lost all sorts of omnipresent stands and sought support and salvation in the Catholic Church. Fearing to make any personal decisions, he tries to rise above all parties and fronts in the name of "all-human tolerance." Still, the young man cannot free himself from the thought that the Church has been linked to fascist doctrine, and, has, in fact, been supporting this "assassin gang." Both Gottlieb and Adolf pursue a Jewish barmaid named Laura who works in a gay bar, and, Gottlieb eventually rapes her. 

Another significant character in the novel is the kinsman of the Essen general, Friedrich Wilhelm Pfaffrath. He is, at first glance, a distinctly orderly person. Although he was once a president and manager of large Nazi properties, although he was part of the German bourgeoisie who unconditionally assumed Hitler's authority, he is now a high-ranking public official - he was elected the first mayor and head of his town. There are many people like him, they have penetrated to all the corners of the Bonn state apparatus, occupying leadership positions, they redefine the destiny of the country. Pfaffrath is real, devoid of demonism, yet, no less ominous than Judejahn. He is filled with the desire to help the former hangmen return to the Federal Republic with impunity, to integrate into the Bonn political system. Pfaffrath believes that the West German society is mature enough to accept the "prodigal son" who has escaped the gallows. Thus, Pfaffrath embodies the vitality of nationalism in the country. Eva's sister, Anna, is married to Friedrich Pfaffrath.

The inescapableness of his stratum is confirmed by the image of the youngest member of his family - the law student Dietrich Pfaffrath. He is a promising careerist who does not worry about moral problems or thoughts about his father's fascist past. Even Judejahn does not interfere with his life - the calculating Dietrich well appreciated that it is not far off the time when his kinship with the former general may be honorable and profitable. Koeppen has conceived the image of Dietrich as a symbol of the resurgent loyalty, which finds its roots in order, the state, and, the mighty power.

Opposed to all these bright negative images, the writer opposes a hero, who can be called the chief one, mostly because he carries some autobiographical traits. The composer Siegfried Pfaffrath, a homosexual and pederast who frequents boy prostitutes, lives after the end of the war in Rome to distance himself from his German relatives and leave behind his father's house. He seeks to express his worldview and musicality by using Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, blasted in the Third Reich. Siegfried loves Rome because he feels alien here. However, he is infinitely lonely and constantly lives on the brink of despair. This is his gut feeling that fills his music. He composed works, deliberately deprived of harmony, expressing his image of the world over which he has overcome the danger of an irreparable crash. For Siegfried, music is an expression of the horror of man in the era of gas chambers and mass murders. His works are a "rebellion against the surrounding reality," against his fatherland, against the war, for whom people like his parents are responsible.

Ilse KÃ¼renberg, wife of the world-renowned conductor, KÃ¼renberg, who presents the first symphony of Siegfried in front of the audience, perceives the dissonant work as a "no-goal search,", conquered by despair. However, she cannot explain whether Siegfried is desperate because he cannot find a way to a meaningful life, or, even if his despair hinders him all the way. And, the conductor, who feels the artist's dissatisfaction with his work, protects him from the danger of closing himself in an "ivory tower" because of the world's disappointment. Siegfried's music is a mockery of the eloquent taste of the self-styled patrons and connoisseurs of art who occupy the ground floor of the concert hall. He dreams of understanding and accepting the young people, the workers, and, the students to whom the future belongs. However, at the concert, the gallery does not accept the composer - it does not perceive in his symphony a resonance of life. This music reflects the tragedy of a talented artist who is unable to break the limits of the denial and develop constructive ideas. Siegfried, although receiving a prize at a modern music competition, is unhappy with the result - he does not applaud his symphony, only the rich snobs from the ground floor do so. And the young composer places great hopes on the music - maybe it is judged "with time to contribute to great changes." Ilse, who is Jewish, survived the Holocaust as she and her Gentile husband could afford to live outside Germany during the war. Siegfried and Adolf are representatives of the generation of sons who do not want to inherit their fathers, and every succession - both the composer and the cleric - seeks new goals and a new meaning for their lives. Both know the exalted suffering of loneliness. From this loneliness Siegfried finds a way out of Rome and leaves for Africa. He hopes to return from there to New York City, with a "black symphony" - a symbol of commitment to the inborn problems of mankind. Gottlieb shoots and kills Ilse, whose father had been victimized by the Nazis, at the novel's end, before suffering a heart attack

#Article: Regunta Yesurathnam
#Type: regular article

Regunta Yesurathnam (16 October 1941 - 8 August 2011) was a Priest hailing from the Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India, headquartered in Medak, notable as a Systematic Theologian and served as Faculty Member from 1974 through 2001 in Secunderabad, Telangana, India at the Andhra Christian Theological College, affiliated to the nation's first University, the Senate of Serampore College (University) {a University under Section 2 (f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956}with degree-granting authority validated by a Danish Charter and ratified by the Government of West Bengal. 

Yesurathnam has been acknowledged for his contribution to the discplines of Dialogical Theology and Comparative religion and his works were listed in the Elenchus of Biblica, an annual bibliography listing published by the Pontifical Biblical Institute, Rome, and his writings began appearing in academic journals that included Dialogue and Alliance, National Council of Churches Review and the International Bulletin of Missionary Research. Paul Arvid Sartison (2008) who researched at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, using a Comparative religion approach to Avatara and Incarnation, puts Yesurathnam in the line of other notable Religions Scholars, namely, Edward Geoffrey Parrinder, Daniel Bassuk, Richard De Smet, SJ, Noel Sheth, and Julius J. Lipner.

As a pupil of the Systematic Theologian Joshua Russell Chandran, CSI under whom he was groomed in the sixties, Yesurathnam established himself as a Scholar and during the subsequent decade, as evidenced by his interest in Dialogical Theology, Yesurathnam seemed to have been influenced by the Religions Scholars, Stanley Jedidiah Samartha, CSI, Herbert Jai Singh, MCI and David C. Scott, MCI. During the initial years of his doctoral research in the seventies, it was Arvind P. Nirmal, CNI (the proponent of Dalit theology) who supervised and enabled Yesurathnam to push through his doctoral studies.

Ever since his Youth, Yesurathnam was inspired by the work of the Christian missions in Telangana by the Roman Catholic missionaries and the Protestant missionaries and the selfless lives they led and avowed to live for Christ his entire life and entered the ministry of the Church through the Diocese of Medak, established by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (that later on united with other Church Societies to form the Church of South India in 1947) becoming a ministerial candidate during the bishopric of Frank Whittaker, the first Bishop - in - Medak stepping into the portals of a Seminary in Bangalore for spiritual formation and ordained in 1967 by Bishop Eber Priestley, then Bishop - in - Medak and led the life of a Priest for nearly half-a-century that ended in 2011 on account of his sudden death.

#Subtitle level 2: Contribution

#Subtitle level 3: Dialogical theology

Yesurathnam sought to engage Christianity with other Religions, through inter-disciplinary research methods, finding ways through which Christianity could relate itself with the rich and diverse religious traditions of India. Pioneers like Bede Griffiths, OSB Cam., Yisu Das Tiwari, MCI, Raimon Panikkar, RCM and Stanley Jedidiah Samartha, CSI have done much much to build inroads for Christianity to explore common ethos in other religions through Interfaith dialogue resulting in yields which has been termed as Dialogical Theology that could propel the Gospel to unexplored ground.

Professor Jutta Sperber (2000) of the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany in a major work about Dialogical Theology with special reference to the activities of the World Council of Churches and its unit on Dialogue has quoted the work of Yesurathnam on the Christian-Muslim dialogue. 

#Subtitle level 3: Comparative religion

The Old Testament Scholars, G. Solomon, STBC (1957), G. Babu Rao, CBCNC (1990) and Madanu Francis, RCM (1998) have expounded the need for comparative analysis, especially in building existential communities and relating to each other in a setting of religions (Sitz im Leben). Yesurathnam's writings on Comparative religion could best be understood if one were to take a look at the Old Testament Scholar, Gnana Robinson's, CSI (1998) work promoting the cause of Interfaith dialogue with special reference to Christianity in the Indian subcontinent,  (adapted)...there are also spiritual traditions other than Christianity, which affirm life and are therefore to be listened to and appreciated, a position many scholars of religion in Europe and America, find it difficult to accept. These spiritual traditions also offer for millions of adherents, essential visions for living, and one cannot brush these aside as matters of no consequence. The God, revealed in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Creator, the Sustainer and the Redeemer of all people and is present and active in all spiritual traditions affirming life, whether they come under the label Christian or not. 

Edward Geoffrey Parrinder (1997) of King's College, London defined Avatara as the manifestation of the divine in human form.  Yesurathnam, also wrote on the work on the concept of Avatara, which has drawn the attention of Scholars and his works were quoted extensively by Research Scholars at the Universities of London and Birmingham, England by Bob Robinson (2004) who took note of the work of Yesurathnam on Avatara with special emphasis on Christianity and by Steven Tsoukalas (2007) who quoted Yesurathnam's work on the forms of Avatara. Similarly, Professor M. Sukdaven (2012), of the University of the Free State, South Africa wrote about the forms of Vishnu Avataras as induced from the Bhagavata Purana and quotes Yesurathnam in stating that the number of Vishnu Avataras may practically be endless.

#Subtitle level 3: Contextualization

Inter-disciplinary writings by Yesurathnam have struck new ground in inculturation as espoused by Swamy Amalorananda and the New Testament Scholar Suppogu Joseph, STBC (2007) had made a sustained research exploring possibilities for the Gospel to adapt itself to the multi-religious ethos of India. Earlier proponents who experimented with Contextualization, emphasizing on the presentation of Christ adapting to the Indian culture, were Robert de Nobili, SJ, E. Stanley Jones, MCI, and B. V. Subbamma, AELC, who together were known for their contribution to the Christian Ashram Movement in India.

Yesurathnam's definition of Contextualization has been acknowledged by Scholars as a resourceful addition. Professor Charles E. Van Engen (2005) of the Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California and Professor Akintunde E. Akinade (2012) of the Georgetown University in Qatar in their works on Contextualization refer to the word Contextualization as defined by Yesurathnam, The term contextualization includes all that is implied in indigenization or inculturation, but also seeks also to include the realities of contemporary, secularity, technology, and the struggle for human justice... Contextualization both extends and corrects the older terminology. While indigenization tends to focus on the purely cultural dimension of human experience, contextualization broadens the understanding of culture to include social, political, and economic questions. In this way, culture is understood in more dynamic and flexible ways, and is seen not as closed and self-contained, but as open and able to be enriched by an encounter with other cultures and movements. 

#Subtitle level 3: Renewal of the Church

Much like the Practical Theologian M. Victor Paul, AELC (1990), Yesurathnam cautioned the Church against falling into traditionalism. During the Golden Jubilee of the founding of the Uniting church, the Church of South India held in Chennai in 1997, Yesurathnam spoke on the ills befalling the Church in India, (Adapted) The church hierarchy of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons and Laity is turning into a Chaturvarna system, with the Laity and Women as the Shudras, the bottom-most caste.  Echoing the apprehensions by Yesurathnam, Stanley Jedidiah Samartha who was also present at the Jubilee in Chennai, pointed out that one must first introspect before raising cudgels against the Indian caste system and believed that one failed to notice the gradual transformation of the episcopacy into such a system.==Studies== 

#Subtitle level 3: Graduate

After initial schooling at the Christian mission schools founded by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS) in Telangana, Yesurathnam discerned his avocation to take up Priesthood during the successive bishoprics of Frank Whittaker and Eber Priestley who became his Spiritual Confessors and led Yesurathnam to take up spiritual studies at the United Theological College, Bangalore {affiliated to the nation's first University, the Senate of Serampore College (University)} during 1963-1967 then under the notable principal Joshua Russell Chandran, CSI and the Old Testament Scholar E. C. John, CSI and other Spiritual Formators. Yesurathnam's companions at the College studying at varying internals included Arvind P. Nirmal, CNI, K. C. Abraham, CSI, C. L. Furtado, CSI, G. T. Abraham, CSI, B. P. Sugandhar, CSI, Wesley Ariarajah, CMC,Philipose Mar Eusebius, MOSC and others. At the subsequent convocation of the Senate of Serampore College (University), Yesurathnam was awarded a B. D. degree during the Registrarship of Chetti Devasahayam, CBCNC.

#Subtitle level 3: Postgraduate

In 1969 during the bishopric of H. D. L. Abraham, Bishop - in - Medak, Yesurathnam was recalled from parish work and sent to the Protestant Regional Theologiate in Bangalore for further spiritual studies leading to M. Th. during 1969-1972 where he researched under Joshua Russell Chandran, CSI. This time around, Yesurathnam's companions included D. W. Jesudoss, TELC, and his graduate companion Philipose Mar Eusebius, MOSC, who returned the same time as Yesurathnam for pursuing postgraduate studies. Yesurathnam's other companions from the graduate section were S. J. Theodore, CSI, P. J. Lawrence, Timotheas Hembrom, NELC, H. S. Wilson, CSI, D. I. Hans, CSI, P. J. Lawrence, CSI, Basil Rebera, J. W. Gladstone, CSI, D. Dhanaraj, CSI, Sydney Salins, CSI, John Sadananda, CSI, Christopher Asir, CSI and others. 

Yesurathnam was awarded the postgraduate degree of M. Th. in the ensuing convocation of University led by the Registrar, Chetti Devasahayam, CBCNC.

#Subtitle level 3: Doctoral

After a 5-year teaching ministry that began in 1974 at the Andhra Christian Theological College, Secunderabad, Yesurathnam qualified to undertake doctoral level research in 1978 and sought a 5-year study leave from then Principal Victor Premasagar, CSI who enabled the leave through the Board of Governors of the College. Yesurathnam's Bishop during that period, B. G. Prasada Rao, Bishop - in - Medak made efforts to ensure that Yesurathnam was able to join his alma mater, the United Theological College, Bangalore, where Yesurathnam was able to take up research in the discipline of Systematic theology under the guidance of the notable Systematic Theologian Arvind P. Nirmal, CNI who incidentally was his graduate companion during 1963-1965. Yesurathnam also came under the tutelage of Stanley Jedidiah Samartha, a leading authority on Dialogical Theology.  During the research period between 1978-1982, Yesurathnam was also sent to the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England in 1979 for a two-year research exposure where he resided in Kingsmead College under the Selly Oak Colleges and was supervised by Walter Jacob Hollenweger. Though Yesurathnam completed his studies in 1982 and rejoined the Andhra Christian Theological College, it was only in 1987, that the Senate of Serampore College (University) awarded the doctoral degree of D. Th. during the Registrarship of D. S. Satyaranjan, IPC. Nearly two decades later, Yesurathnam sought permission from the Senate of Serampore College (University) to publish his doctoral work in 2006.

#Subtitle level 3: Pastoral ministry

Yesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Bishop Eber Priestley, then Bishop - in - Medak and was assigned ministerial functions in the parishes falling under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak, shepherding congregations for nearly a decade until he was recalled in 1974 by then Bishop H. D. L. Abraham, Bishop - in - Medak and re-assigned the role of a Spiritual Formator.

In 1992, when Victor Premasagar, CSI vacated the bishopric of Medak on attaining superannuation, the ensuing Sede vacante was contested among whom Yesurathnam stood in the fray for the vacant bishopric, which was overseen by Ryder Devapriam, CSI, then Moderator of the Church of South India Synod and a former colleague of Yesurathnam at the Protestant Regional Theologiate. However, the sudden death of Ryder Devapriam, CSI on 4 September 1992 while in Germany turned the tides for those in fray, resulting in the appointment and subsequent consecration of B. P. Sugandhar, CSI.

#Subtitle level 3: Teaching ministry

In 1972, the Andhra Christian Theological College (founded in 1964 and managed by the Anglicans, Congregationalists, Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists, and the Wesleyans) moved from Rajahmundry to Secunderabad. The Systematic Theologian, Waldo Penner, CBCNC, one of the co-founders of the College hailing from the Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars did not move to the new location in Secunderabad and the unfilled vacancy that arose was sourced by inviting Yesurathnam from the Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India. Yesurathnam joined the College during in 1974 during the Principalship of the Cantabrigian and Old Testament Scholar, Victor Premasagar, CSI and his colleagues in Systematic theology were Ryder Devapriam, CSI later joined by B. J. Christie Kumar, STBC in 1977 and the two led the teaching of Systematic theology for nearly a decade until they were joined in 1984 by G. Dyvasirvadam, CSI.  In 1986 when Suppogu Joseph, STBC became Principal of the College, the Systematic Theologian JÃ¼rgen Fangmeier, from Germany came to teach as a Guest Professor enriching the discipline of Systematic theology at the College followed by Ray Waldock from Canada.

In 1993, during the Principalship of M. Victor Paul, AELC, Yesurathnam was sent to the :de:Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal/Bethel, Germany as Guest Professor where he taught for a year and returned in 1994 to take up the Principalship of the College for a 4-year period that saw new faculty which joined the College comprising K. Reuben Mark, the present Bishop - in - Karimnagar and others. 

Yesurathnam spent nearly a quarter of a century during 1974-2001 at the Protestant Regional Theologiate in Secunderabad in teaching successive ministerial aspirants along with notable faculty members that included W. D. Coleman, AELC, R. R. Sundara Rao, AELC, G. Devasahayam, AELC, G. Solomon, STBC, Ravela Joseph, STBC, Suppogu Joseph, STBC, Eric J. Lott, CSI, Ryder Devapriam, CSI, G. T. Abraham, CSI, and Muriel Spurgeon Carder, CBCNC, which coincided with the teaching period of Udamala Bala, RCM and Anthoniraj Thumma, RCM, then Faculty Members in the discipline of Systematic theology at the St. John's Regional Seminary (Theologiate), the Catholic Regional Theologiate in Ramanthapur.

In 1998, the four-year cycle of Principalship passed on from the Church of South India to the Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars which was represented by a two-member faculty comprising the Church Historian D. J. Jeremiah, CBCNC and the Religions Teacher, K. D. G. Prakasa Rao, CBCNC. Meanwhile, Yesurathnam proceeded on a year's sabbatical leave in 1998 to the Overseas Ministries Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut to continue his research pursuits and rejoined the Theologiate in Secunderabad and after continuing to teach for two more years', he accepted a call for overseas missionary service and bid farewell to the Theologiate in 2001.

#Subtitle level 3: Missionary service

The Council for World Mission (CWM) headquartered in England is involved in missionary enterprise in far reached areas around the globe. During the tenure of G. Dyvasirvadam, CSI as General Secretary at the Church of South India Synod, efforts were made by the CWM to garner missionary service from the participating dioceses of the Church of South India. Yesurathnam's former colleague, G. Dyvasirvadam, CSI sought the permission of B. P. Sugandhar, then Bishop - in - Medak to enable Yesurathnam's missionary service to the United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and in 2001, Yesurathnam moved to the International University of the Caribbean, Kingston (Jamaica) where he began his sojourn in the New millennium and served as a theological educator for nearly a decade until his sudden death on 8 August 2011 at the Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.

#Subtitle level 2: Legacy and writings

The sudden death of Yesurathnam in 2011 was mourned by the theological fraternity in the Indian subcontinent. During the 86th meeting of the Senate of Serampore College (University), under the Presidentship of The Right Reverend Issac Mar Philoxenos Episcopa, MMTSC, held in Dehradun in February 2012, the nearly 100 Senate Members, being members, invitees, and guests, observed silence for those Theologians deceased during the period under review (2011-2012) for which a prayer was offered by the New Testament Scholar, Takatemjen Ao, NBCC of the Nagaland Baptist Church Council.

#Subtitle level 3: Ministerial

#Article: St. John de Britto College
#Type: regular article

St. John de Britto College is a private, Catholic, Portuguese school founded in 1947, run by Society of Jesus.

#Subtitle level 2: Foundation and development

Expelled from the country soon after the establishment of the First Republic, the Jesuits would return to Portugal in 1923. However, the juridical situation of the Jesuits in Portugal was normalized only with the 1933 Constitution and with the decree of May 12, 1941, which in following the 1940 Concordat recognized the Society of Jesus as a missionary corporation, enabling them to return to their educational and cultural activities. 

In 1947, Father Tobias Ferraz, SJ, Provincial of the Society of Jesus, acquired the Stromp estate at Lumiar, where Franz Liszt, at the beginning of 1846, had delighted the family with his piano playing. The new college, which occupied a pre-existing building, received the name and patronage of the Portuguese Saint John de Britto, who had been canonized only months before on 22 June 1947.

Inspired by Ignatian pedagogy and spirituality, the College is chartered and has autonomy for an in definite period, and has as its mission statement to "with excellence, train men and women for others and with others." Located in Lisbon, it has grown to enroll more than 1600 students for Pre-school, Basic Education, and Secondary Education. 

The Old House was refitted to accommodate the Jesuits, who moved in on 23 October 1947. On October 28 the College was formally constituted and on November 3 opened with 11 students, Fr. JoÃ£o Cabral, SJ, being rector. As enrollment grew the College required new facilities and in 1950 the architect LicÃ­nio Cruz was commissioned. Construction began on 7 October 1950, and occupancy a year later: classrooms, kitchen, dispensary, and dining room. On 7 October 1955 the college church, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, was solemnly blessed and inaugurated by the Cardinal-Patriarch Manuel GonÃ§alves Cerejeira. The second phase of the building began in 1964, and was completed on 3 April 1965. Further infrastructure followed: primary pavilion (1976), tennis courts ( 1991), sports gymnasium (1993), another building for primary (1994), new refectory and bar (1995), administrative services (1996), auditorium (1997), swimming pool (1998), new facilities for CEB children (2000), soccer field with synthetic grass (2004), and rearrangement of pedestrian accesses and parking lots (2005).

#Subtitle level 2: Continuing education of the faculty

The College has a training plan for the teaching staff that aims to improve teaching through collaboration among teachers and school-wide integration of best practices. Such mobilization for collaborative work assists problem solving in the educational context. Teachers become active participants, horizontally, in the professional development process, assuming as a mutual task the implementation of innovative teaching and learning strategies.

#Subtitle level 2: Extracurricular activities

There is a Language Center where students can learn or deepen their knowledge of English, French, Spanish and Mandarin. Also a Fitness Center for localized gymnastics, hygienic gymnastics, and water aerobics. Sponsored sports are handball, gymnastics, football, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Other extracurricular activities include ballet, creative dance, hip-hop, theater, dramatic expression, piano, viola, chess, and drums, as well as a summer sports program.

#Subtitle level 2: Honor Roll

Honor Roll aims to distinguish students who excel in various areas of human, social, and academic achievement. It marks the progress made at each academic stage, valuing attitudes rather than results, albeit without neglecting academic excellence as a central objective in the school program. 

The prizes were designed to recognize values â€‹â‹and attitudes, rather than concrete and purely academic results, reflecting the goal of providing students with a comprehensive education and lifting up the Ignatian ideal of themagis. Thus, with the exception of the School Achievement award which recognizes academic results, all other awards recognize values â€‹â‹essential for integral Christian humanism as outlined in the College's Educational Project: spirit and dedication (Sports Prize), participation in the activities organized by the College and the spontaneous promotion of cultural or recreational activities (Participation and Initiative), the arts (Artistic Creativity), involvement in the area of â€‹â‹religious culture (Religious Culture), fortitude and determination (Application and Effort), and finally identification with the ideology (Educate for Service). 

#Subtitle level 2: JosÃ© Carlos Belchior Prize

In 1987, the Association of Former Students of the College awarded the JosÃ© Carlos Belchior Prize to one of its former students, in recognition of commitment to the ideal of Educate to Serve, values by which they lived in permanent commitment to others:  1987 - JoÃ£o Queiroz e Melo

#Article: Antifa (United States)
#Type: regular article

Antifa is a far-left militant political movement of autonomous, self-described anti-fascist groups in the United States. The term is loosely used to refer to anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobia, as well as anarchist and anti-capitalist groups. Unlike the traditional left, the ambit of self-described antifa groups is to oppose fascism in direct action. These groups are usually anti-government and anti-capitalist, and their methodologies and tactics are more aggressively violent and anarchistic than those of associated groups in the far left.

According to The Economist, the "word Antifa has its roots in Anti-Fascist Action, a name taken up by European political movements in the 1930s" which was revived in the 1990s, particularly in Germany. Peter Beinart writes that "in the late â€80s, left-wing punk fans in the United States began following suit, though they initially called their groups Anti-Racist Action, on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than fascism." Antifa groups are known for militant protest tactics, including property damage and sometimes physical violence. Antifa focuses more on fighting far-right ideology than encouraging pro-left policy.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The first group described as Antifa was the Antifaschistische Aktion formed in 1930s Germany. Anti-fascists were also involved in battles against Benito Mussoliniâ€™s Blackshirts, Adolf Hitlerâ€™s Brownshirts and Francisco Franco's nationalist army. Outside of Europe, anti-fascist tactics were used as a model for anti-Japanese resistance in occupied-China during World War II. 

Groups forming in the United States "initially called their groups Anti-Racist Action Network, on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than fascism." In Minneapolis, Minnesota a group called the Baldies in 1987 formed a group with the intent to fight neo-Nazi groups.

Antifa groups either form loose support networks, such as NYC Antifa, or operate independently.

#Subtitle level 2: Activity

Antifa is composed of autonomous groups, not a formal organization. Activists typically organize protests via social media and through websites and list-serves. According to Salon.com it is an organizing strategy, not a group of people, and is commonly associated with a willingness to engage in a show of force. Antifa groups have most notably protested the 2016 election of Donald Trump. During the inauguration celebrations mask-wearing black bloc protestors "raged across the area just outside" of the security perimeter, "smashing windows and burning cars." 

According to Peter Beinart, Antifa activists "combat white supremacism not by trying to change government policy but through direct action. They try to publicly identify white supremacists and get them fired from their jobs and evicted from their apartments," in addition to "disrupt(ing) white-supremacist rallies, including by force."

In June 2017 Antifa was linked to anarchist extremism by the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness.

#Subtitle level 3: Street violence

Antifa protesters participated in the 2017 Berkeley protests where they gained mainstream media attention, "throwing Molotov cocktails and smashing windows." Later, two Antifa groups threatened to disrupt the 2017 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade after hearing that the Multnomah County Republican Party would participate. The parade organizers received an anonymous email, saying, "You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely". The email also said that 200 people would "rush into the parade" and "drag and push" those marching with the Republican Party. The two groups denied having anything to do with the email. The parade ended up being canceled by the organizers due to safety concerns. 

Antifa counter protestors at the the far-right 2017 Unite the Right rally In Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 "certainly used clubs and dyed liquids against the white supremacists." Journalist Adele Stan interviewed an Antifa protester at the rally who said that the sticks carried by Antifa protesters are a justifiable countermeasure to the fact that "the right has a goon squad." Some Antifa participants at the Charlottesville rally chanted that counter-protesters should "punch a Nazi in the mouth."

#Subtitle level 2: Approaches

The nature and activities of Antifa have caused some debate among anarchists; the prominent anarcho-communist website Itâ€™s Going Down published a critique of Antifa in November 2016 originally from Lucha No Feik, entitled On Antifa: Some Critical Notes. The article criticised Antifa for essentially being a reactive, rather than a proactive force. The article argues that Antifa are too hyper-focused on micro Neo-Nazi groups or single figures such as President Donald Trump, instead of "analyzing the structural nature of our racist society." It's Going Down stated that the Antifa's ideological position was "but a few steps removed from the Liberal position that we should just all get along." It also pointed out that Antifa did not protest against the administration of President Barack Obama. This elicited a response from three active participants in the movement with What do US Antifascists Actually Believe?, where they stated, "Mobilizing large radical movements against neoliberal (or populist) capitalism is not the focus of anti-fascism; this is the work of the anarchist and anti-capitalist movements as a whole."

According to National Public Radio, "People who speak for the Antifa movement acknowledge they sometimes carry clubs and sticks," and their "approach is confrontational." CNN describes Antifa as "known for causing damage to property during protests." Scott Crow, described by CNN as "a longtime Antifa organizer," argues that destroying property is not a form of violence. 

According to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, Antifa activists participate in violent actions because "they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist." According to Antifa organizer Crow, Antifa is based on the idea of direct action, "The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that. And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece."

#Article: AmÃ©dÃ©e MÃ©nard
#Type: regular article

AmÃ©dÃ©e-RenÃ© MÃ©nard (16 October 1806 â€ 22 October, 1873) was a French  academic sculptor and art teacher.

#Subtitle level 2: Biography

AmÃ©dÃ©e MÃ©nard was born in Nantes, France, the son of RenÃ© FranÃ§ois MÃ©nard, a timber merchant. He studied art with local sculptors and joined a workshop specializing in statuary. In 1825 he moved to Paris for further studies with the sculptor Ã‰tienne-Jules Ramey. He spent most of the following decade in Paris, where he showed regularly at the Salon, before returning to settle permanently in Nantes.

MÃ©nard sculpted large statues of historical and mythological characters as well as some bas reliefs and architectural elements such as pediments. Most of his work was intended for public display outdoors or in churches, and much of his surviving work can be found in such locations. A few of his smaller pieces are in museums like the Angers Museum of Fine Arts.

He taught art at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later in Nantes. Among his students in Nantes were the sculptor Charles-Auguste Lebourg and the painter Auguste Toulmouche.

MÃ©nard died at home in Nantes and was buried in a nearby cemetery.

#Article: Edward Ward (cricketer)
#Type: regular article

Edward Ewer Ward (16 July 1847 - 25 March 1940), born Edward Ewer Harrison, was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played in 11 first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) between 1868 and 1871. He was born at Timworth, Suffolk and died at Gorleston, Norfolk. He changed his name from "Harrison" to "Ward" in August 1868.

Ward was educated privately at Bury St Edmunds and at Jesus College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm bowler: sources disagree about whether he was a fast bowler or a medium-paced one, but agree that he bowled in the round-arm style. He played in three matches for Cambridge University in 1868 as "E. E. Harrison" without making much impact, and was then not picked for any first-team games at all in 1869. He returned to the university team in 1870 and took seven wickets in his first game, against MCC. That led to his selection for the 1870 University Match against Oxford University, a game that has been widely known as "Cobden's Match" through the feat of the Cambridge bowler Frank Cobden, who took the last three Oxford wickets in three balls - a hat-trick - to win the game for Cambridge by just two runs. Ward was just as influential in the Cambridge victory, his six wickets for 29 in the Oxford second innings, in 32 four-ball overs, being the best bowling performance of his first-class cricket career. He returned to the Cambridge side in 1871, but was less effective, and the University Match of that year, in which he failed to take any wickets, was his last first-class match. He later played minor cricket for Suffolk County Cricket Club.

Ward graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1872 and in the same year he was ordained as a Church of England deacon, becoming a priest two years later. He had a highly itinerant clerical career, serving parishes in Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Northumberland, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, retiring in 1931.

In 2013, Bethel released three albums: Without Words, Tides and Discover Bethel Music. Released in March alongside Integrity Music, Without Words was Bethel's first instrumental remix album. When the Official Charts Company launched the Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart for the identifying the top twenty bestselling Christian and Gospel releases in the United Kingdom in March 2013, Bethel made it's debut on the chart with two releases in the top ten: Without Words at No. 2 and For the Sake of the World at No. 6. The release of Tides, the collective's first studio album, followed in early September, becoming Bethel's first No. 1 on the Christian Albums Chart in the United States, and on the Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart in the United Kingdom whilst making Bethel's debut on the all-genre Official Albums Chart at No. 79. Tides Live was released in early 2014, repeating the feat of topping the Christian Albums Chart in the US and the UK's Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart.

In April 2014, You Make Me Brave was released, becoming Bethel's first Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200, being the tenth best-selling album in the United States for the week ending May 10.

January 2015 saw the release of the collective's seventh live album, We Will Not Be Shaken, which, having sold nearly 30,000 copies in it's debut retail week, became their third consecutive album to top both Christian music charts in the US and the UK, and the collective's first Top 10 entry on Billboard's Canadian Albums Chart and the Official New Zealand Music Chart, peaking at 9 in Canada for the week ending February 14, also being the tenth best-selling album in New Zealand at its peak. Without Words: Synesthesia, their second instrumental remix album, was released on the last day of July in the same year, becoming the collective's eighth Top 10 on Billboard's Christian Albums Chart peaking at No 2.

Bethel Music released Have It All in March 2016, it's first live album to be recorded at Bethel Church since For the Sake of the World and their fourth album overall to be recorded at Bethel Church. Have It All started at No. 2 on the Billboard Christian Albums Chart in it's opening week with 25,000 copies sold, peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard 200. The album also broke into the Top 10 of Australia's ARIA Top 100 Albums Chart at No. 8. Starlight was released on April 7, 2017, selling 20,000 equivalent album units in the week ending April 13, also rising to No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart dated April 29, 2017. Starlight made its debut on the ARIA Albums Chart at No. 15, becoming the fourth album by Bethel Music to enter Australia's Top 50 Albums Chart.

#Article: Christ the King, Cockfosters
#Type: regular article

Christ the King (Vita et Pax) is an architecturally notable former priory of the Olivetan order in Bramley Road, Cockfosters, north London.

It was founded in 1930 by Dom Constantine Bosschaerts, formerly a monk of the Belgian Province of the Cassinese Congregation of the Primitive Observance. The building is dated to 1940 and its design credited to Bosschaerts in Pevsner.

Part of the building was later the Benedictine Centre for Spirituality, and is now the Cockfosters Spirituality Centre.

The parish church of the Parish of Christ The King in Cockfosters occupies part of the building which was intended to form the parish hall for a larger church. Since 2014 the parish has been administered by the Chemin Neuf Community.



#Article: John Aisance
#Type: regular article

John Aisance (Ojibwe name Aisance) was a chief among the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe and leader of the Otter clan of that people from at least 1815 until his death in 1847. He participated in the Lake Simcoe-Lake Huron Purchase in 1815, served the provincial government during the Upper Canada Rebellion, and was the first and founding chief of the Beausoleil First Nation.

#Subtitle level 2: Early Life and Land Treaties

Aisance's father, also called Aisance, preceded him as chief and clan leader. Their identical names have created confusion and debate among historians. The family's principal territorial interests seem to have lain in Penetanguishene and the surrounding area. It was the elder Aisance, apparently, whose name is recorded among the five Ojibwe chiefs who authorized the surrender of the area to the provincial government in the Penetanguishene Bay Purchase in 1798. In 1815, the younger Aisance participated alongside two other chiefs, including Musquakie, the future head chief, in authorizing the Lake Simcoe-Lake Huron Purchase, surrendering 250,000 acres of territory extending from the Penetanguishene area to the north shore of Kempenfelt Bay (present-day North Simcoe).

#Subtitle level 2: Coldwater

In 1817, Musquakie succeeded his father Yellow Head as head chief of the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. The next year, he four other chiefs authorized the Lake Simcoe-Nottawasaga Purchase, surrendering 1,600,000 acres of territory west of Lake Simcoe to the government. Aisance was not involved in this purchaseâ€”the Otter clan was represented instead by Muskigonceâ€”which left the Ojibwe with virtually no territory of their own, although they reserved the right to continue to range and hunt across the land they had relinquished.

In 1828, the Ojibwe reportedly "expressed a strong desire to be admitted to Christianity, and to adopt the habits of civilized life". When they converted to Methodism later that year, Aisance, the foremost of Musquakie's subordinate chiefs, set an example by dismissing two of his three wives. Presumably it was now that he adopted the Christian name John. In 1830, the Ojibwe were induced by Lieutenant Governor John Colborne to settle permanently in two purpose-built villages, one at Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching, where Musquakie settled with a part of his people, and the other at Gissinausebing, or Coldwater, where Aisance settled with the remainder of the Ojibwe. The house built for him there by the government was the only frame house in a village otherwise made up of log houses, in recognition of his chiefly status.

Although Colborne's agents considered that this settlement and "civilizing" experiment was succeeding, Aisance quickly became disillusioned with the government agents and Methodist missionaries with whom he was obliged to deal. In 1832 he even converted to Roman Catholicism, his band following suit. In 1836, Francis Bond Head replaced Colborne as Lieutenant Governor and soon brought the experiment to an end. He opened talks with Musquakie and Aisance and persuaded them to leave the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor (which had remained Crown land), enticing them with the promise of one-third of the proceeds of the anticipated sales of lots there to European settlers. In 1842, Aisance joined four other chiefs in signing Musquakie's complaint to Governor General Charles Bagot, protesting that Bond Head had not fully explained the 1836 purchase agreement, and had, in particular, not made it clear that it did not involve an upfront, lump-sum payment, nor that the Ojibwe would receive only one-third of the sale proceeds. At their request, the proceeds of the piecemeal sales of lots in the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor were subsequently banked so that the Ojibwe could receive an annual income from the interest, which they divided three ways between Musquakie's band, Aisance's band and a third band led by Joseph Snake settled on the islands of Lake Simcoe. The chiefs also claimed ongoing Ojibwe ownership of the grist mill at Coldwater, which finally passed from their hands in 1849.

#Subtitle level 2: Upper Canada Rebellion

Towards the end of 1838, Bond Head called the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe to arms to help keep the peace in the wake of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837-38. Aisance dutifully assembled twenty-one warriors, abandoning the autumn hunt in the process, and followed Musquakie to an encampment at Holland Landing. The Ojibwe were soon dismissed, at which they complained "most bitterly" to government agents that the small stipend paid to them for this brief period of service was too little to offset the economic blow of having been compelled to abandon their hunting. In response to this outcry, the government approved the payment of rations to the Ojibwe until the end of February 1839.

#Subtitle level 2: Beausoleil Island

As a consequence of the 1836 purchase agreement with Bond Head, the Ojibwe were required to abandon the villages built for them by Colborne. In 1842, Aisance and his band left Coldwater and relocated to Beausoleil Island in Georgian Bay, a move that brought them closer to their chief's native country around Penetanguishene. Henceforth the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island conducted themselves as a distinct people from Musquakie's band, who had settled at Rama.

Under Aisance's leadership, the Beausoleil settlement prospered modestly in stark contrast to the decay that reportedly took place at Rama. The Ojibwe, numbering 232 persons in 1842, grew steadily more able at growing corn and potatoes, rearing livestock, and making sugar, and their settlement grew slowly, eventually adding a school house. Notwithstanding a promising beginning, Aisance, frustrated by the poor soils on the island (which some blamed on the Ojibwe's cultivating technique), almost immediately hatched a plan for relocating westwards to the more fertile Christian Island which the chief did not live to see come to fruition. In 1856, the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island joined "a few Pottawatamies and Ottawas" already settled on Christian Island, their arrival marking the beginnings of the present-day Beausoleil First Nation, whose main reserve is still on Christian Island.

#Subtitle level 2: Death

John Aisance died in 1847, reportedly drowning in a canoeing accident.



#Article: Tenrikyo Church Headquarters
#Type: regular article

Tenrikyo Church Headquarters (Tenrikyo Kyokai Honbu å¤©ç†æ•™æ•™ä¼šæœ¬éƒ) is the main headquarters of the Tenrikyo religion, located in Tenri, Nara, Japan. This establishment is significant to followers because it is built around the Jiba, the spot where followers believe the god Tenri-O-no-Mikoto conceived humankind.

#Subtitle level 2: History

#Subtitle level 3: Background

Due to constant persecution from local government authorities and from members of established religions, the followers of Tenrikyo wanted to apply for legal authorization to establish a church. However, Japanese law during the Meiji period stipulated that legal authorization could only be granted if the church were classified under an established tradition, such as Shinto, Buddhism, or Christianity. Though Tenrikyo does not consider itself a Shinto tradition, early followers agreed to file under Shinto in order to obtain the protections from legal authorization. Several failed attempts were made; the first one was in April 29, 1885 to the governor of Osaka Prefecture.

#Subtitle level 3: Under Shinto Main Bureau (1888-1899)

Tenrikyo Church Headquarters was established in 1888 as a religious organization belonging to the Shinto Main Bureau (ç¥žé“æœå± Shinto Honkyoku). The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers could seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for missionary work. The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers, who labeled the religion as "anti-social."

On April 6, 1896, the Home Ministry (å†…å‹™çœ Naimu-shÅ) issued "Directive No. 12," which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the state polity of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together, the obstruction of medical treatment and the alleged policy of enforced donations."

The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state's demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the "Service". The name of the Tenrikyo deity Tenri-O-no-Mikoto was changed to Tenri-no-Okami. Tenrikyo's doctrine was altered to conform with the official State Shinto doctrine. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by Miki Nakayama.

#Subtitle level 3: Preparing for independence from Shinto Main Bureau (1899-1908)

In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the Meiji government, which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.

On April 1, 1900, Tenri Seminary, Tenrikyoâ€™s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.

In 1903, a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the Meiji kyoten, or the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the Mikagura-uta ("The Songs for the Service"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.

Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in Taiwan (1897), Korea (1904), Manchuria (1911), the U.S. (1927), Brazil, and Southeast Asian countries.

#Subtitle level 3: Independence from Shinto Main Bureau (1908-1937)

The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first shinbashira, the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the Three Religions Conference (ä¸‰æ•™ä¼šåŒ Sankyokaido) including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners. Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of section one of the Mikagura-uta was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministryâ€™s directive. 

In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become Tenri Central Library. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girlsâ€ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. 

In 1928, the Ofudesaki was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the Osashizu was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. 

On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the Kagura Service was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.

#Subtitle level 3: Wartime Japan (1937-1945)

As the war between Japan and China grew from the Mukden Incident to the Second Sino-Japanese War, state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of Omotokyo Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.

After the National Mobilization Law was passed in 1938, Japanâ€™s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the Ofudesaki and Osashizu were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the Mikagura-uta,, and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 Religious Organizations Law further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.

#Subtitle level 3: After World War II (1945-present)

In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the surrender of Japan and the conclusion of World War II as fukugen, or "restoration." One of the significant aspects of the "restoration" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the Mikagura-uta in 1946, the Ofudesaki in 1948, and the Osashizu in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.

Another aspect of the "restoration" was the construction of the Oyasato-yakata, begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.

The "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue," a symposium cosponsored by Tenri University and Pontifical Gregorian University, was held in Rome, Italy from March 9-11, 1998. Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II," held at Tenri, Japan from September 28-30, 2002.

#Article: Commonitorium (Orientius)
#Type: regular article

The Commonitorium () is the name of an elegiac poem by the Christian Latin poet Orientius, written sometime in the 5th century. Composed of 1036 verses and divided into two books, the poem describes the way to heaven, with warnings against its hindrances.

#Subtitle level 2: Contents and style

The Commonitorium is a Latin elegiac poem written in couplets that focuses mostly on morality and theology. The work is didactic, and aims to teach one how to attain eternal salvation, all the while warning the reader of the seven deadly sins. To further emphasize his point, Orientius discusses punishments that are awaiting in Hell, as well as the Last Judgement. And although the purpose of the poem is to instruct the reader in the proper way to live, the Latinist Johannes Schwind notes that the work is interjected with "occasional elements of diatribe and satire." In terms of style, the poet emulates the Christian poets Coelius Sedulius (fl. early 5th century AD) and possibly Prudentius (fl. late 4th century AD). The poem also quotes the Republican poet Catullus, and the Imperial poets Ovid and Virgil.

#Subtitle level 2: Textual history

The Commonitorium was rediscovered at the end of the sixteenth century by a Jesuit named Rosweyd at Anchin Abbey, preserved in the manuscript known as Codex Aquicinctensis. Rosweyd informed his Jesuit colleague, Martin Delrio, who dubbed it the Commonitorium and published the editio princeps of the poem in 1600; this edition was marred slightly by the fact that Codex Aquicinctensisand thus Delrio's versionpreserved only the first book of the Commonitorium. Within a hundred years, a second manuscript (Codex Ashburnhamensis, also known as Codex Turonensis) was discovered in Turin that contained the Commonitoriums second book, which allowed the French Benedictine historian and liturgist Edmond MartÃ¨ne to publish the first complete edition of the poem in 1700. Then, in 1774, the Italian Oratorian and patristic scholar Andrea Gallandi published a second complete edition of the poem. In 1888, the Classicist Robinson Ellis published an edition of the work, which in 1911 Adrian Fortescue referred to as "the best modern edition". Today, the Commonitorium is preserved in only in Codex Ashburnhamensis, as Codex Aquicinctensis was long ago lost. The former manuscript also contains two prayers attributed to Orientius and four short poems of unknown authorship.



#Article: Augustinerkirche, Mainz
#Type: regular article

The church of St. Augustin known in German as Augustinerkirche, was the minster of the Augustine friars in the city centre of Mainz. Today it is the seminary church of the Catholic theological seminary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The church was built from 1768 to 1771 on the site of a Gothic church building on the Augustinian Street, dating to 1260.  The builders were Augustinian hermits, who had already built the predecessor building and whose fraternity endured from 1260 to the Imperial Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803. The name of the master mason is not known.

After the secularization of the monastery in 1803, the building ensemble became a seminary comprising a church of the diocese of the newly created bishopric in 1805. The church was not destroyed in World War II.

#Subtitle level 2: Architecture

Despite its late origins, the exterior of the church is very much associated with the baroque style. Due to the surrounding property with the convent and seminar buildings and other houses, it is only possible to see the church with its mighty towerless faÃ§ade that overlooks the other buildings of the old town. Above the portal rises a group of personalities created for the church by Nikolaus Binterim. It is essentially the coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven, flanked by Augustine of Hippo, patron saint and ruler of the Augustinian order, and his mother Monica of Hippo. In the south and east of the church are the former convent buildings and rooms of the seminar, which were built between 1737 and 1753. The wing of the monastery complex has a beautiful portal with figures, which also come from Nikolas Binterim, after the faÃ§ade of the church itself. The interior of the church tends to rococo, which is expressed by a fusion of nave and choir a concept that is increasingly found in the Rococo stylistic.

#Subtitle level 2: Interior

The altars are according to the Rococo style, but the late construction of the church is illustrated here in that the echoes of Classicism can be found. The furnishing makes a very rich impression through the large altars and the ceiling paintings created by Johann Baptist Enderle in 1772.

In the church a Mary, mother of Jesus sculpture of 1420 is displayed, which was transferred to the Augustin church in 1807 from the demolished Gothic â€³Liebfrauenkircheâ€ (St. Maria ad Gradus), located beneath Mainz Cathedral.

#Subtitle level 2: Pipe organ

As one of the few examples of a baroque pipe organ one of the famous organ manufacturer family Stumm is placed in the Augustinian church, since 1773 the organ has been preserved to a large extent original. The instrument has 31 registers on two manuals and pedal. The play-and register tracker actions are mechanical.

The Synodic Act of the Heretic of Armenin Armenia, The Martyr MartinÂ (ChurchÂ Slavonic: Ð¡Ð¾Ð±Ð¾ÌÑ€Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð´ÒÑ§ÌÐ½Ñ—Ðµ Ð½Ð° Ñ”Ñ€ÐµÑ‚Ð¸ÐºÐ°Ì Ð°Ñ€Ð¼Ñ§Ð½Ð¸ÌÐ½Ð°, Ð½Ð° Ð¼Ð½Ð¸ÌÑ…Ð° Ð¼Ð°Ñ€Ñ‚Ð¸ÌÐ½Ð°) is a forged work created at the very beginning of the 18th century byÂ Dimitry RostovskyÂ against theÂ Old Rite shortly before his death, and was actively used by the missionaries of theÂ Synodal periodÂ inÂ Russian Orthodox ChurchÂ who were attempting to convert the Old Believers. The main character of the Synodic Act of the Heretic of Armenia isÂ Martin ArmeninÂ orÂ Martin the ArmenianÂ - a heretic and a monk.Â Martin Armenin was included as the name of a true person in many authoritative historical monographs and in the liturgical text in the Russian Orthodox Church.

Today, the Russian Orthodox Church recognizes that the work is a forgery, as stated by Patriarch Kirill in the Russian Orthodox Encyclopedia.

#Subtitle level 2: Background Information and Reasons for Creating the Forgery

In the middle of the 17th century,Â reformsÂ beganÂ in the Russian Church by Patriarch Nikon, rituals were unified by Greek models. To this end, the Russian ancient rites were declared heretical, and their followers were proclaimedÂ heretics and anathematized.Â (Some then-saints were included in these anathemas, such as Saint Anna of Kashin, whom had been previously glorified.)Even before the start of the reform,Â Arseny (Sukhanov)Â had a debate with the Greeks regarding how to fold the fingers while making the sign of the cross. The Greeks reproached Arseny, claiming that the Russians were baptized likeÂ Armenians, to which Arseny (correctly) replied that the Armenians preserved the ancient tradition.Â At theÂ Moscow Local Council in 1656, theÂ Patriarch of Antioch, Macarius (who would later unsuccessfully attempt to unite his church with Rome), announced those baptizing in this way were "arrogant imitators", and the bishops signed this decision.Â B.A. UspenskyÂ explains this by the fact that Armenians, like the Russians, were baptized in the 17th century with a double finger sign of the cross, unlike all the other monophysites. In his opinion, the Armenians had adopted the two-finger sign of the cross earlier from the Greeks.

After the church anathemas (the Synod of 1656 and theÂ Great Moscow Synod), and the unsuccessful but brutal repressions of those who continued using the Old Rite - consisting of torture and murder - a new direction was chosen to fight the Old Rite: the taxation of the Old Believers with a double tax and the use of falsifications. Following this decision, the future Russian Orthodox saint Dimitry of Rostov created the Synodic Act.

#Subtitle level 2: The Forgery

Less than a year before his death, duringÂ the reign of Peter I, Dimitry of Rostov created the forged anti-Old Rite work "The Synodic Act on the Heretic of Armenien, the Martyr Martin". The document claims that a monk and heretic named Martin, an Armenian, arrived in Russia from Constantinople in 1149, and pretending to be a Greek and a relative of the patriarchÂ Luke Chrysosterg, began to preach in Russia heresy. This heresy consisted of a combination of Armenian and Latin heresies (and according to the "Acts", Martin learned this heresy Rome itself). Subsequently, adopted by the Russians, the heresy consisted of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, saying the Jesus Prayer instead of the name of the Trinity while making the sign of the cross,Â and using two alleluias insteadÂ of three alleluias. Especially for his heresy of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, he was condemned at the Council of Kiev in 1160, under the Grand DukeÂ Rostislav MstislavichÂ and MetropolitanÂ Constantine. Later, he was condemned at the Council of Constantinople during the following year, 1161, under Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges, from which the document claims to originate. Subsequently, Martin was burned.

#Subtitle level 2: Promotion of the Forgery by the Russian Orthodox Church

A book with a story about the alleged heretic Martin was printed with the blessing of the Most Holy Synod repeatedly, in 1721, 1726, 1752, and - finally - in 1913.Â In addition, Dimitry of Rostov was canonized, and at the end of theÂ 18th centuryÂ he was written by an akathist which included a section about the mythical heretic Martin.Â The akathist was written by a priest of the MoscowÂ Cathedral of Christ the Savior, John Alexeyev.Â The text of the akathist was studied at three meetings of theÂ Holy SynodÂ in 1800 (July 2, July 13 and August 8).Â The synod then approved the text of the akathist and gave him the blessing to print it, which was done, and it is still the akathist used for him today.

A rough translation of the akathist to Dimitry of Rostov, fourthÂ kontakion:The storm of heresies, from the underworld through Aria in Greece, was revived in the latter days by the machinations of Martin Armenin; and through the Believers in the Fatherland, still attempts to silence and destroy the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. You, the good shepherd, for the love of your sheep, you drove away these soul-destroying wolves, you tamed the storm of insanity, and you taught the faithful to say to the Trinitarian God: Alleluia.The Troparion in Tone VIII hints at his work against the Old Believers as well:O lover of Orthodoxy and uprooter of schism, healer of Russia and new advocate before God, by thy writings thou didst heal the minds of the foolish. O blessed Demetrius, thou harp of the Spirit, entreat Christ God, that our souls may be saved.In addition, the mythical heretic Martin and his condemnation by the invented Kiev Synod were taught as a real event in the higher spiritual educational institutions, including the theological academy, where the priesthood and bishops were being prepared, and the priests from the pulpit preached throughout the Synodal period as though Martin was a true historical figure.Â The name of Martin can be found in a large number of authors of the synodal period, including but not limited to: Saint MetropolitanÂ Arsenius (Matseyevich), MetropolitanÂ Simon of Moscow, Archbishop Nikephoros Theotokis, the Optina elder Saint Joseph of Optina, ArchimandriteÂ Jerome (Alyakrinsky),Â SaintÂ Theophan the Recluse, MetropolitanÂ Macarius (Bulgakov), and Saint Ignatius (Bryanchaninov).

A number of secular historians, suchÂ as Sergey Solovyov, also wrote about Martin Armenin as a real historical person.

#Article: Metropolis of Ancyra
#Type: regular article

The Metropolis of Ancyra (ÎœÎ·Ï„ÏÏŒÏ€Î¿Î»Î¹Ï‚ á¼ˆÎ³ÎºÏÏÎ±Ï) was a Christian (Eastern Orthodox after the East-West Schism) bishopric in Ancyra (modern Ankara, Turkey) and metropolitan see of Galatia Prima. The see survived the Seljuk Turkish conquest at the end of the 11th century, and remained active until the end of the Ottoman Empire and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923.

#Subtitle level 2: History

#Subtitle level 3: Early Christianity

The city of Ancyra had been the political centre of the Roman province of Galatia since its establishment in 25 BC. The arrival of Christianity in Ancyra is probably to be dated to the time of the Apostles in the mid-1st century AD, but is attested in the sources only much later. Modern historians suggest that Apostles Peter and Andrew in person preached in the city, and founded the local Church, with a certain Cresces, a disciple of the Apostle Paul, who lived between 56 and 117 AD, as the city's first bishop. The existence of a Christian Church in Ancyra is not attested until around 180, and the earliest attested bishop, however, is Theodore, who became a martyr during one of the anti-Christian persecutions of the 3rd century. Other important early Christian martyrs, who developed a considerable local cult, were Plato of Ancyra and Clement of Ancyra.

The city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity: Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra and Basil of Ancyra were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in 314, in 358, and in 375, the latter two in favour of Arianism. Emperor Julian () visited the city during his ill-fated Persian campaign in 362, and reportedly ordered the execution of the martyrs Basil and Gemellus; a third condemned, Busiris, was spared his life.

#Subtitle level 3: Byzantine period

When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia Prima, as well as becoming its ecclesiastical centre (metropolitan see). Nevertheless, the official titelature of the Metropolitans of Ancyra remained "hypertimos and exarch of all Galatia" throughout the see's existence. Its original suffragan sees in the Notitiae Episcopatuum were Aspona, Juliopolis, Kinna, Lagania (Anastasiopolis), Mnizus, and Tabia. To them were added Verinopolis in the 7th century, and Kalymne in the 9th century. Among the metropolitan sees subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Ancyra occupied a high place, coming fourth after Caesarea in Cappadocia, Ephesus, and Heraclea in Thrace. 

Some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of Palladius of Galatia and Nilus of Galatia. Two convents for women are attested in the 6th century (one dedicated to the Theotokos Beeia and the Monastery of Petrin), and a male monastery called Attaline is attested in the 7th century. Despite the reduction of the town's size to a small fortified core after the Persian conquest in 622, Ancyra remained an important centre in subsequent centuries, as the capital of the Opsician Theme from the mid-7th to the late 8th century, and of the Bucellarian Theme thereafter.

Under Constantine X Doukas (), the suffragan bishopric of Basilaion (Juliopolis) was raised to metropolitan rank to honour its incumbent, but although the elevation was intended to be temporary, after the latter died, his successors continued to claim metropolitan status. This led to a dispute between Emperor Alexios I Komnenos () and Metropolitan Niketas of Ancyra, which ended with Basilaion retaining its new status. Apart from Basilaion/Juliopolis, the sees of Aspona and Verinopolis also appear to have been temporarily lost to Ancyra.

#Subtitle level 3: Turkish rule and Ottoman period

The city fell to the Seljuk Turks in the decade after the Battle of Manzikert (1071), and remained under Turkish rule thereafter, with the exception of a brief period of restored Byzantine control after 1101. The Turkish conquest meant the isolation of Ancyra, at least until the Ottoman period, from the Constantinople and the Patriarchate, and began a prolonged period of decline of the local Christian population. As a result, it is often unclear whether the metropolitans from the 12th century onwards resided in their see; until the early 17th century, there are many documented cases of the administration of the see being given to other metropolises. Nevertheless, the Metropolis of Ancyra continued to exist until the Greco-Turkish population exchange of 1923. 

In the second half of the 12th century the see of Ancyra was temporarily united to that of Nazianzus, while in 1173, the patriarchal synod allowed the incumbent metropolitan to transfer to the see of Kerasus, which was still in Byzantine hands. A Christian population in the city is attested during the reign of Andronikos II Palaiologos () in the story of the neomartyr Niketas, who was lector at a church in Ancyra. At the same time, however, the sources register complaints that the Metropolitan had abandoned his see, and in 1310/14 the territory of Ancyra was transferred to the Metropolis of Gangra, while the incumbent received the sees of Philippi and Chrysopolis in Thrace as compensation. During the second half of the 14th century, the Notitiae 19 and 20 record that the Metropolis of Ancyra had been awarded to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, but in 1395-1406 there was again a Metropolitan of Ancyra, Macarius, a distinguished theologian who accompanied Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos in his voyage to Western Europe. After 1406 Ancyra was again awarded to Gangra, but in 1438 the see is held by the Metropolitan of Cyzicus; a Metropolitan of Ancyra Constantine is attested , but in councils held in Constantinople (now under Ottoman rule) in 1471/72 and 1483/84, Ancyra was represented (and possibly again held) by Thessalonica; in between, however, in 1475, an incumbent metropolitan is attested as attending the ordination of Patriarch Raphael I of Constantinople. The situation is further confused by the reference to an active metropolis in patriarchal ordinances of 1483 and 1525. The situation is clearer beginning with the metropolitanate of Parthenius (1602-1631), who appears to have resided in his see, and engaged himself in trying to restore its flock and finances, that had suffered greatly as a result of the Celali rebellions in the previous decades. Parthenius' successors were most likely likewise residents of Ankara. However, accurate information on the incumbents is only available from the middle of the 19th century on. 

The local Christian population declined quickly during the first centuries after the Turkish conquest. In the Ottoman tax registers of 1488/89, in the entirety of the Sanjak of Ankara, a total of 822 households owing the jizya (the per capital tax on non-Muslims) are recorded. In 1522, the number of Christian households is estimated at 277, and the respective population at 1,500, as against 15,000 Muslims and around 200 Jews. The registers also indicate that Armenian names, and hence followers of the Armenian Church, predominated among the local Christian population. The existence of Greek Orthodox population alongside Armenians and Jews is confirmed by the German traveller Dernschwam in 1553. This reflects a situation that was still apparent in the 1880s, when the French ethnologist Vital Cuinet estimated the Christian population of the Ankara Vilayet at 34,009 Greek Orthodox, 83,063 Armenians of the Armenian Church, and smaller Armenian Catholic and Protestant communities. The numerical weakness of the flock was one reason for the frequent absence of a residential Metropolitan in the 15th-16th centuries. More importantly, the Christian population that remained was dispersed and isolated in small communities, with low social, educational, and financial standing, who suffered further decline during the Celali rebellions. In order to counterbalance this, on the suggestion of Metropolitan Parthenius, in 1610 a number of towns (Tilhissar, Ä°nebolu, and Tosya) were transferred from the Metropolis of Gangra; the latter never acquiesced to this, however, and within the next few decades secured their return.

The Metropolis of Ancyra retained its traditional high rank among the metropolises of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, at least until 1715, when it is still recorded in the fourth place in the Syntagmation of Chrysanthos of Jerusalem. In the list of Patriarch Seraphim II of Constantinople in 1759, however, it was demoted to 31st place; it fell further to 32nd by 1855, but rose again to 29th by 1901. Nevertheless, the same period saw a considerable turnaround in the fortunes of the local Greek population. The powerful Ã‡apanoglu family restored order and prosperity in the area in the 18th century, and the upturn in trade benefited the local Christian population, which was also increased by the immigration of Cappadocian Greeks from the area of Caesarea (Kayseri) and of Pontic Greeks, seeking employment in the Ak DaÄŸ mines. As a result of the Cappadocian immigration, however, it is likely that the Orthodox of the sanjaks of Yozgat, Ã‡orum and KirÅŸehir, which along with the Sanjak of Ankara constituted the Ankara Vilayet, were under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Caesarea rather than Ancyra. 

In the late 19th century, the Metropolis of Ancyra comprised the Sanjak of Ankara in the Ankara Vilayet and the kazas of KÃ¼tahya and Eskisehir in the HÃ¼davendigÃ¢r Vilayet. Its actual size however was even smaller, as Orthodox communities resided only in eight settlements: Ankara, the town of Haymana, and the villages of Dikmen and KÃ¶ceren in the Sanjak of Ankara, and KÃ¼tahya, Eskisehir, and the villages of Ä°spir and KÃ¶Ã§oÄŸlu near the latter. At the beginning of the 20th century, the annual income of the metropolis was estimated at 200,000 piastres, and according to the registers of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, comprised a flock of 10,598 in 1913/14, of which 2,251 in Ankara (up from 1,637 in 1881), 4,398 in KÃ¼tahya (4,050 in the 1880s), 407 in Haymana (23 in 1881), 2,952 or 1,941 in Eskisehir (1,147 in the 1880s), and the rest in the smaller settlements. This reflects the important role played to the metropolis' numerical strength by the communities further west, around KÃ¼tahya and Eskisehir, which had been incorporated into it at some unknown point. The Metropolis of Ancyra still remained one of the smaller metropolises in Asia Minor during the late Ottoman period; only the metropolises of Philadelphia and Kydoniai were smaller still. The local Christians were mostly Turcophone (Karamanlides). Only the higher clergy, government officials, and headmasters of schools were Greek-speakers. At the same time, however, there was no presence of Catholic converts among the local Greek population, although the foundation of Greek schools in the 1870s and 1880s increased the knowledge of Greek.

Following the population exchange, and the departure of all Christians in the region, the last incumbent, Metropolitan Constantine (1922-1934), resided in Istanbul.

#Article: L. Fidelia Woolley Gillette
#Type: regular article

Reverend Lucia Fidelia Woolley Gillette (April 8, 1827 - October 14, 1905) was among the first women ordained Universalist minister in the United States and the first woman ordained of any denomination in Canada.

#Subtitle level 2: Early life

Lucia Fidelia Woolley was born in Nelson, New York, on April 8, 1827. She was the daughter of Rev. Edward Mott Woolley and Laura Smith, and the oldest of a family of seven children. Her ancestry was English and French.

When Woolley was still a child the family moved often in the New York State: on her grandparents' farm in Cazenovia, New York, in Munnsville, New York, where her father opened a leather shop, and in 1841 in Bridgewater, New York, where her father was an Universalist minister.

Woolley was an extremely timid and sensitive child, but an enthusiast about her studies. Her father expected her, when she was a mere girl, to read books upon abstruse subjects and to be able to talk about them with himself and his friends, but the distinguishing characteristic of her childhood was spontaneous sympathy for every living thing and all her life it had made her the helper of the helpless and the friend "of such as are in bunds".

Woolley attended the Cazenovia Seminary and the Bridgewater Academy.

#Subtitle level 2: Career

L. Fidelia Woolley Gillette's literary work started when she was 16 years old under the pen-names "Lyra" and "Carrie Russell", "Ruth Dinsmore" and her own name. Her poems and prose articles appeared in various papers and magazines.

In 1847, Woolley's father moved to a small farm near Birmingham, Michigan, ministering at Pontiac and Birmingham, and Wolley took a teaching position.

On August 21, 1873, Gillette obtained a license to preach and was ordained in 1877. She was among the first women ordained Universalist minister, Augusta Jane Chapin being the first on December 7, 1864, in Lansing, Michigan. In 1888 Gillette was the first woman ordained to preach of any denomination in Canada: she was ministering at the Universalist Church of Bloomfield, Prince Edward County, Ontario.

Gillette's published works are: "Pebbles From the Shore" (1879), "Floating Leaves" (1881), "Editorials and Other Waifs" (1889) and a memoir of her father, "Memoir of Rev. Edward Mott Woolley" (1855), who was a popular minister in the Universalist Church. There was a faint suggestion of the dramatic in Gillette's style of speaking that gave it charm; the elegance of her language, the richness of her imagery, the striking and original character of her illustrations was as refreshing as they were entertaining.

Gillette's missionary and pastoral work lasted several years. She wrote hymns, like: "Be True, Boys!", "The Beautiful World", "Come to My Kingdom", "I Will Not Forget, Our Father Is True" and "Jesus Leads Me Every Day".

Gillette lectured on women's issues, religious and literary issues, and campaigned for woman's suffrage. Gillette's lectures received high praise. In 1874 Gillette was selected to represent the Michigan State Woman Suffrage Association in Lansing. In October 1874, Gillette opened and closed the 6th annual meeting of the National Woman Suffrage Association in Detroit. She was the women's rights editor for the Rochester Era.

#Subtitle level 2: Personal life

On December 23, 1850, Fidelia Woolley married Hartson Gillette (1816-1886) and they had one daughter, Florence Lillian Gillette Flett (1851-1900), actress, dramatist and poet.

In the 1860s, Gillette moved with her family to Rochester, Michigan, where her husband ran the Rochester mill. In February 1864 Hartson Gillette enlisted in the 22nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In Rochester, Gillette helped founding the Rochester Woman's Club.

In 1873, Gillette's daughter, Florence, joined a theater company based in Chicago and later married Eugene Russell Soggs, an actor, on February 25, 1875. She married again, on July 9, 1889, to George A. Flett, a bookkeeper, and actor. She died on June 10, 1900, after five years of paresis, and her dying wish was to be buried in Southern California, which her mother accomplished: she is buried at Pomona, California.

#Article: Lule people
#Type: regular article

The Lule people, or Lules, are an indigenous people in Argentina. They were originally encountered in the area that is now the Salta Province of Argentina, as well as in nearby areas of modern-day Bolivia and Paraguay. They were later displaced by the WichÃ­ toward the south of Salta Province, the north-east of Santiago del Estero Province, and the north of TucumÃ¡n Province. The Lule language is distantly related to the Vilela language, and together they form the Lule-Vilela language family. Today, 3,721 people in Argentina claim Lule ethnic affiliation, according to the 2010 census.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The Lules lived in the same region as the Vilela, and shared many cultural characteristics despite linguistic differences. They also had relationships with the TonocotÃ© and the Mataraes. The Lule people were made up of the following groups: EsistinÃ©, TokistinÃ©, OristinÃ©, AxostinÃ©, TamborinÃ©, GuaxastinÃ©, and CasutinÃ©.

The Lules were generally hunter-gatherers and therefore lived a nomadic lifestyle. However, they also cultivated a wide variety of plants for food, including maize, calabaza, potato, and quinoa. Sedentary populations settled down on the western edges of the modern-day city of Salta. In these settlements, a clear Andean influence on their culture and way of life can be established. One major example of this Andean cultural influence is the domestication of animals in the lamini family for use as pack animals and for the production of wool and meat.

In order to convert them to Christianity, the Jesuits founded a mission near San Isidro de Lules in TucumÃ¡n province in 1670. This mission remained active until 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled. During the mission's existence, it often traded and sold the Lule and Diaguita indigenous population of the area to members of the landed oligarchy, plantations, and colonial workshops.

In 1708, Esteban de UrÃ­zar, the governor of TucumÃ¡n, carried out a punitive campaign against the indigenous peoples of the Gran Chaco, including the Lules. Following that campaign, Jesuits from Salta established a mission, San Juan Bautista de Balbuena, next to Fort Balbuena. The mission was home to 400 Lules, primarily from the the EsistinÃ© and TokistinÃ© groups. On August 7, 1715, Father Antonio Machoni moved the mission to Fort Miraflores, establishing the mission of San Esteban de Miraflores on the banks of the Salado River. Thirteen years later, in 1728, natives destroyed the mission in a rebellion; the Lules left the mission and dispersed throughout the land. In 1752, the mission was restored but in a different location, 170 km to the south-east of the city of Salta.  After the Jesuits were expelled in 1768, the mission passed into Franciscan control, but it became permanently abandoned by the turn of the nineteenth century.

#Subtitle level 2: Today

The descendants of the Lules have partly, but incompletely, mixed and acculturated into the predominantly white population and culture of Argentina. In the following settlements, there are a number of residents who identify themselves as belonging to the Lule people:

	Las Costas, Salta Province (250 families)

	El Retiro, Santiago del Estero Province

	El Nogalito, Lules Department, TucumÃ¡n Province (80 families)

	Mala Mala, Lules Department, TucumÃ¡n Province (25 families)

	El SiambÃ³n, TafÃ­ Viejo Department, TucumÃ¡n Province (45 families)

	La Oyada, TafÃ­ Viejo Department, TucumÃ¡n Province (15 families)

The 2004-2005 Complementary Indigenous Survey identified 854 Argentines of first-generation Lule descent. The 2010 Argentine Census identified 3,721 individuals who identified as being of Lule ethnicity.

#Article: Our Lady of the Rosary of Orani
#Type: regular article

#Subtitle level 2: The Image of Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Rosario, la Virgen Milagrosa de Orani

The Spanish Dominican friars arrived in the province of Bataan (then known as the Partido de Bataan and considered part of Pampanga) in 1587 and founded the parish of Abucay on June 10, 1588, placing it under the patronage of Sto. Domingo de Guzman, the founder of the Order of Preachers or the Dominican Order. As such, Abucay is considered to be the second oldest parish administered by the Dominicans in the Philippines, having been founded immediately after the establishment of the Dominican motherhouse of Sto. Domingo in Manila. The Dominican frailes brought with them the miraculous image of Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Rosario, a custom followed by the Dominican Order in all of their new missions in keeping with their calling to promote the devotion to the Holy Rosary.

In 1596, the Dominican friars established the "visita" of Samal, under the parish of Abucay and transferred the image thereto. According to oral tradition, shortly after Samal was established as a Parish on April 20, 1644, the statue disappeared from its altar and was later found under a camachile tree near a creek, some 5 kilometers north of Samal. The people of Samal tried to return the image to their church but the same phenomenon occurred three times: the image returned to the same camachile tree where it had been found. The people interpreted this strange occurrence as a sign of God's will that the image should remain in Orani, so a small "visita" was built on that very spot.

Orani prospered as a town and its population subsequently increased. Alongside this development, the devotion to the Virgin of the Rosary grew so fast that at that time, she was already being called "la Virgen Milagrosa" or the Miraculous Virgin, due to her numerous miracles which drew thousands of pilgrims from nearby provinces such as Bulacan, Pampanga and Zamabales. This exponential growth eventually led to the establishment of Orani as an independent parish or VicarÃ­a on April 21, 1714.

A life-sized image measuring one "estadio" or 1.68 cm, the image of the Virgen Milagrosa is a traditional Baroque rendition of the Mother and Child, in particular, that of our Lady of the Rosary. The statue is made out of wood, fully sculpted in the round, including the clothes, although she is dressed with real vestments donated by her devotees, following a tradition of vesting images of saints in Spain and the New World that continues to this day. The Virgin carries the Child Jesus with her left arm and, instead of the usual Rosary in the right arm, she holds a cane or walking stick (bastÃ³n) as well as a scepter, while a Rosary hangs around her neck. The Christ Child holds a globe in His left hand while extending His right arm in a blessing. Rosaries hang from the necks of both Mother and Child following the way the Spanish Dominican missionaries wore the rosary and following a custom of the faithful in Spain and her colonies at the time, in order to gain special indulgences. She is garbed with a blue mantle that extends from her back and is tucked in her waist, and wears a white robe that was originally red but was repainted at a later date. A white veil covers her head in the manner of Jewish women at the time of Jesus.

Considering its large size, the image could be considered rare for that time. Some historians opine that it was intentionally made big to commemorate an important event or milestone, such as the founding of the Dominican mission in Bataan, the first outside Manila for the Dominicans. The size could also indicate that the image was meant to be enshrined at a church altar, hence its dimensions.

As to the origin of the image of the Virgen Milagrosa, there are some theories which claim that the statue originated from Spain (on board the galleons that transported soldiers and the frailes from Spain to the New World). Nevertheless, considering the length and difficulty of the voyage from the Mother Country to the Philippines, as well as the precious space on board the galleons, bringing an image so large would simply have been impractical. Another theory states that it came from Mexico, just like the image of La Naval de Manila, whose presence during the Dominicans missionaries' first voyage to the Philippines in 1587 was recorded by the frailes. The fact that the Orani image was not mentioned at all is highly indicative that it was not on the same journey. Claims that it came on a later journey, however, would clash with accounts by the Dominicans that it was brought to Bataan in 1587. Still, others claim that it was made in the Philippines, sometime between July 1587 and June 1588, just in time for the formal establishment of the Parish of Abucay. An analysis of the technique and rendition of the image's features may indicate a Philippine provenance. Elements such as the suksok (a carved and stylistic rendition of the mantle, tucked into the waist at the back) confirms this theory, aside from the features on the Virgin's face. Furthermore, at that time, there were already many able artisans (mostly Chinese) in Manila and its environs who could carve religious images after being taught by the religious orders that arrived first in the Philippines. The abundance of talented sculptors was noted by the Dominican Bishop of Manila (the first in the country), Domingo de Salazar, when he wrote King Philip II of Spain in 1590. Most of these artisans were Sangleys (Chinese) living in the PariÃ¡n, an enclave of Manila also administered by the Dominicans.

On December 11, 1965, an article written by Oscar R. Landicho was published in the Chronicle magazine claiming that the Virgen Milagrosa was made by a "Greek" slave named Pere Morey in 1360. According to the article, Pere Morey was the father of Pere Oller and Pere Johan. To set the record straight, Pere Morey was not from Greece but was a subject of the Kingdom of AragÃ³n (which would later become the Kingdom of Spain after its unification with the Kingdom of Castille in the 15th century). Morey was active in the island of Mallorca (then part of the Kingdom of AragÃ³n) as a master mason (stonecutter)as well as an architect, and worked in the construction of various churches. Secondly, he was not related to Pere Oller and Pere Johan who were Gothic-style sculptors in the region of Catalunya. The writer may have been misled by the common name Pere (Pedro) which was not a surname or a family name but rather a first name. Pere Morey himself lived during the Gothic period of architecture and sculpture in Europe so to attribute to him a Baroque image like the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani would be something hard, if not impossible, to explain. Even in the remotest chance that the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani was made in 1360, it would be highly improbable that its devotees would have allowed the Dominican missionaries to take away to a distant land an image that would already have been more than 200 years old at that time (in the 1580s). Pere Morey is not to be confused with Pere Morey Servera, an award-winning Catalan writer born in 1941 and who is still active to this day.

#Subtitle level 3: Miracles of the Virgen Milagrosa

In the Battles of La Naval de Manila from 1646 to 1647 against the Protestant Netherlands (that vied with Catholic Spain for colonial supremacy in the Orient), the Dutch invaders took Corregidor and plundered the coast of Bataan but Kapamgpangan and Orani natives under the protection of the Virgin of Orani defeated the Dutch forces who reached their shores. The Dutch marauders who succeeded in plundering Abucay, were also struck by a plague, and were forced to return to Batavia (modern-day Indonesia).

Even in the early years of the Dominicans in Bataan, the new converts already looked up to her as their â€œprotector and guideâ€ and â€œimplored her with love and a lively faith in all their tribulations in life.â€ Many miracles were wrought through her intercession and were fortunately recorded by the Dominicans as a proof of her fame as a â€œmiracle-worker.â€ One account speaks of the mysterious retreat of aggressive aetas who had sought to destroy the town, which was then a village of Samal. Pertinent investigations later showed that a heavenly Matron with a â€œstern countenanceâ€ appeared to the assaulting tribesmen and drove them off. The consensus was that this lady was the Virgin.

There is also the story of a locust plague in 1718 that, for some odd reason, spared only the province of Bataan. Despite the parish priestâ€™s plea for the people to take measures against the plague, the only thing that the townspeople did was to pray at the Virginâ€™s shrine and their prayers were not in vain. A strong wind blew away the swarm of insects into the sea.

Also famous is the case of a judge from Manila, D. Gregorio de la Villa, who, being gravely ill, sought the Virginâ€™s help to cure the malady that left him almost totally paralyzed. Even before finishing the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa - he was already up and about and in the pink of health. Just as renowned is the case of a young boy from Bagbag (present-day Novaliches) who died. During his wake, his bereaved mother pleaded to the Virgen Milagrosa del Rosario and sought her maternal compassion. To the surprise of those present, the dead boy stood up and walked to his mother. In gratitude, both mother and child made a pilgrimage to Orani where they relayed what had happened to them to the Parish Priest who confirmed the authenticity of the miracle.

Also healed after praying the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa was a leper from Catanggalan (present-day Obando, Bulacan) whose healing over the nine days of the novena was witnessed by the Parish priest and by the faithful of Orani. The same Dominicans who recorded these miracles were wise to point out that as a result of these miracles, the devotion to the Virgin of Orani had enjoyed a â€œgrowing progressionâ€ and that â€œseveral volumes would be necessary to narrate the favors and that God has given though her.â€

In return, the grateful people of Orani, would bring herbs and flowers to adorn her altar, as well as oil to fuel her lamp. The flowers and herbs and even the oil were later deemed miraculous by the people, just like the waters that sprung from the Virginâ€™s fountain, which was erected by the townspeople near the port, in her honor. The rich citizens of Orani and Samal, as well as some officials from as far away as Binondo, would donate jewels to her, as recorded in a 1750 inventory of her trousseau. On the other hand, the simple peasants of Orani would dance the â€œJota de Oraniâ€ at the entrance of the church, as a token of gratitude for bountiful harvests. The shrine would also become the â€œmost beautiful church in the provinceâ€ and its reconstruction after the many fires and earthquakes that destroyed the building in the 19th and 20th century never lacked funds thanks to the piety and generosity of the people of Bataan and its neighboring provinces.

This piety and generosity was proven during the great fire of March 16, 1938, which destroyed three fourths of Orani. During the fire, the image was partially damaged but was not totally burned. It was later repaired in the bahay kastila owned by the Salaverria family (the matriarch, Filomena Pascual de Salaverria was the image's camarera) located just beside the church. The Blessed Sacrament also escaped the conflagration and was found miraculously intact after the fire. The church, despite the hardships the people of Orani endured, was rebuilt in a short time thanks to the people's devotion to their patroness.

During World War II, according to the accounts of Ms. Luling Casimiro, one of the seamstresses of the image, a Japanese soldier arrogantly aimed his gun at the statue, but scampered away in fright after the magazine of his gun melted and bent right before his very eyes.

When most of Luzon's seawaters were hit by the Red Tide in the 1990s, Orani's fishermen prayed to the Virgen Milagrosa for help, and Orani's fishing waters were mysteriously spared. To the surprise of the image's caretakers, the hemline of the Virgen's dress was found wet and muddied as though she had gone out to the coast to banish away the red tide.

After the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, citizens of Porac, Pampanga came to Orani during the town fiesta to give thanks, claiming that the Sto. Rosario of Orani had appeared to them in their dreams telling them to flee to higher grounds to escape the onslaught of lahar. At about the time the lahar had flowed, caretakers of the image found that the Virgen's saya was wet and soiled with lahar as if the Virgin had travelled to Pampanga to come to the aid of her devotees.

#Subtitle level 3: Veneration

In recognition of the widespread devotion to the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani, Pope Pius XII approved on October 7, 1958 the Canonical Coronation of the image. The actual coronation would take place on April 18, 1959 in a solemn ceremony led by the Archbishop of San Fernando, Emilio Cinense, and the Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Salvatore Sino.

In 1965, six years after the Canonical Coronation of the Virgen Milagrosa, Mr. Joaquin Mayoralgo, a native of Orani, approached then Parish Priest, Msgr. Emiliano Santos, claiming that he had the "original" image of the Virgen (i.e., the one that was brought by the Spaniards to Bataan) in his possession. When asked by Msgr. Santos how the image came into his possession, Mr. Mayoralgo claimed that he bought the image in an antique shop in Manila that had allegedly acquired it from an American G.I. who, in turn, supposedly found it floating in a river in Cavite in the 1940s. According to the claim, the G.I. was returning to the United States so he decided to get money to finance his trip by selling the image to the antique shop. Mr. Mayoralgo wanted the Monsignor to exchange the image he bought from the antique shop for the canonically crowned Image enshrined in the Parish Church, which he wanted to bring home. Msgr. Santos refused to surrender the image in Church to Mr. Mayoralgo, defending its antiquity and authenticity, but in order to appease Mr. Mayoralgo, allowed him to use this 1965 image as the official replica of the one enshrined at church. Mr. Mayoralgo decided to crown his image in 1965 (using the 1959 coronation regalia) and have a chapel built in the barrio of Silahis to enshrine his image, which he continued to claim as the original. He also had a novena (without the required Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur) printed and distributed, wherein he expressed the same claims. To date, the Diocese has not and does not recognize his claims while maintaining the authenticity of the Canonically Crowned Image in the Parish Church. The Diocese, however, allows the veneration of the image of Silahis in its chapel as an expression of the people's piety towards the Virgin. On April 18, 1984, Cardinal Jaime Sin led the celebrations for the 25th Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation. The 50th or Golden Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation was also celebrated with the presence of Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales in 2009.

The feast of the Virgen Milagrosa de Orani is celebrated by hundreds of thousands of devotees from all parts of Luzon, who flock to her shrine every second Sunday of October. At the shrine, the pilgrims pray the Rosary, hear Mass, receive Holy Communion and kiss the mantle of the Virgin at the back of the church. The town fiesta of Orani is considered by many as the most lively and joyous in Bataan, and even the whole of Central Luzon, due to the huge number of pilgrims who travel starting on the first day of the novena till the feast day itself. Throughout the town, marching bands can seen and heard, while stalls selling different products - from food to toys and clothing - line the plaza, the church area as well as main thoroughfares. On the feast day itself, Masses are celebrated every hour from 3:00 a.m. till 9:00 p.m. and all of these Masses are always brimming with people. Busloads of pilgrims from all over the country also visit her shrine throughout the year, usually on weekends. The Second Saturday of every month has been declared as the official pilgrimage day to Shrine. Devotees who fulfill the conditions of confession, communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions may gain a Plenary Indulgence on August 5, on the major feast days of the Virgin Mary or on a day of their choice once a year. This is in virtue of the Shrine's inscription as Spiritual Affiliate of the Archbasilica of St. Mary Major in Rome in September 2012.

#Article: Mary V. Riley
#Type: regular article

Mary V. Riley (December 24, 1908-October 5, 1987) was an Apache tribal council member who was instrumental in the economic development of the White Mountain Apache Tribe. She was the first woman to be elected to serve on the tribal council and worked toward bringing timber and tourism industries to the reservation to ensure their economic stability. She was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame posthumously in 1988.

#Subtitle level 2: Early life

Mary Velasquez was born on December 24, 1908 at Fort Apache, on the White Mountain Apache Reservation to Nalatzalay (Belle nÃ©e Ivins) and Jesus Velasquez. Her father was born in Fort Davis, Texas to Mexican nationals from Coahuila, MartÃ­n and Juana (nÃ©e Rivers) Velasquez, and came to Fort Apache traveling with soldiers from Ft. Davis, as a child with his mother. He worked for a time as a translator and scout and then managed a ranch where he provided supplies to the soldiers at the fort. Her mother was a full-blood Apache and the daughter of Nadischaay. Velasquez and her siblings grew up on their father's farm, helping with farm chores. She attended three years of school, but was forced to leave in the 1918 flu pandemic to help with sick relatives.

Though she was unable to return to school, Velasquez became fluent in three languages: Apache, Spanish, and English. She read newspapers widely. Velasquez first married Kurt Johnson and then around 1936, married Peter Kessay Riley, with whom she raised her five children, all of whom were also trilingual, and to whom she stressed the importance of gaining an education. She farmed as her father had, raising corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash, as well as turkey, goat and sheep.

#Subtitle level 2: Tribal career

In 1958, Riley became the first woman elected to serve on the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council. She served on the health, education and welfare committee of the tribe and at various times, chaired the committee. She made numerous trips to both the state capital, Phoenix and federal capital in Washington, D. C., lobbying on behalf of the tribe. In an effort to improve situations for tribal members, she evaluated many programs for both economic and socio-cultural gains, looking at federal programs such as Job Corps the Boy Scouts of America, and Bureau of Indian Affairs loan programs for economic development. Riley represented three districts of the reservation and was instrumental in projects, such as the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex, the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO), and the Sunrise Park Ski Resort and Hotel, among others, to expand the tribal enterprises and provide economic stability for the tribe. 

Ground was broken for FATCO in 1962 and by 1963 had replaced the hiring of outside operators to manage the timber reserves of the tribe. By managing their own lumber harvests and operating three saw mills, the tribe was able to provide both jobs for tribal members and goods to sell to a wider clientele. Around the same time, the Alchesay-Williams Hatchery was developed to stock the local lakes which had been created on the reservation and protect species listed as threatened or endangered. Employment opportunities for tribal members were increased through jobs at the hatchery, related jobs in the tourism sector, and additional revenues were garnered through the sale of fishing licenses. One of the largest projects was to convert 1.6 million acres of their lands into the Sunrise Park Resort. Constructing 20 recreational lakes, campsites, fishing and hunting venues, a ski resort, and hotels, the Tribal Council utilized their lands to generate a year-round tourist industry. 

Riley was interviewed as part of an Oral History Project sponsored by the Arizona State Department of Libraries and Archives in 1977. After twenty years on the council, Riley retired in 1978. She was honored by the state in 1984 during the Statehood Day Celebrations for her leadership and development. Profits from FATCO were used to build the Mary V. Riley Building, which houses the tribal educational department.

#Subtitle level 2: Death and legacy

Riley died on October 5, 1987 at White Mountain River Indian Hospital in Whiteriver, Arizona. Posthumously, she was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame, in 1988. 



#Article: Authentic Renewal Organization
#Type: regular article

The Authentic Renewal Organization (ORA) is an Evangelical and Pentecostal political party in Venezuela, originally founded in 1988 by Godofredo MarÃ­n and Carlos Mendez as the first Evangelical political party there.

The party considers that Christianity is not a political ideology of the left, right, or center and that its form of government would be under the "sacred and noble Christian principles of love, peace, faith and hope, but above all the Love of God and neighbor, tolerance, religious freedom and political pluralism." It also promotes participatory and pro-active democracy and a state-religion-neighbor alliance that does not work exclusively for Christians but with "pluralist Christology."

#Subtitle level 2: History

In his first electoral participation, the party nominated one of the founders, Godofredo RamÃ³n MarÃ­n, as a candidate in the general elections of 1988. The electoral promise of the party was based on "governing Venezuela for five years according to the Evangelical Bible," but the party and the candidate did not obtain the results expected to be in the fourth place with 0.87% of the votes. However, the organization obtained two seats in the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Republic. The deputies who were elected at that time, Mr. Gabriel NiÃ±o Laguado, representative of the Zulia State and Dr. Modesto Rivero, for the Federal District, now the Capital District. In 1993 ORA obtained a position by the Federal District in the Chamber of Deputies.

In 1998 the party came into conflict when one sector decided to support the candidacy of Claudio Fermin to the Presidency of the Republic and the other led by the party's president, Godofredo MarÃ­n, resolved to support the candidate of the Democratic Action party Luis Alfaro Ucero. Finally the latter is registered but the leadership of his party decides, later, to withdraw the support for which his nomination lost force, obtaining only 0.38% of the votes, of which ORA contributed 0.11%. That fact caused a fracture of the party making difficult its options for the general elections of 2000, in which they did not run for presidential candidate nor obtained seats in the then newly installed National Assembly.

Its last political participation was also in 1998, after this, the inscription of the political grouping was canceled by the National Electoral Council for not having fulfilled its leaders of that time with its process of renovation which led to the extinction of ORA like political party. 

#Subtitle level 2: Revival of ORA

In 2010, political leader Luis Reyes Castillo, until then General Secretary of the YOUNG political party, establishes ORA not as a political party, but as a "Christian, social and political movement" that in a period of two years fulfilled the requirements demanded by the National Electoral Council, for which it was reinscribed. In 2012, Luis Reyes Castillo launched his candidacy for the Presidency of the Republic by this party and reaches the sum of 8,212 votes, which represented 0.05% of registered voters. Former political leader Juan Gonzalez, one of the founders of the original party in 1987, accused Reyes Castillo of kidnapping this political organization and its acronyms. According to GonzÃ¡lez, Reyes Castillo discovered that ORA lacked leadership and resigned the General Secretariat of his then-party, the YOUNG political movement, to reorganize the ORA party, without consulting its founders. In the elections of 14 of April of 2013, after the death of President Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the party supported the candidate candidate and acting president Nicolas Maduro. This support is still maintained today, although the organization has submitted its own candidates for the municipal elections in Venezuela to be held on December 8, 2013.

#Article: Good News Newspapers
#Type: regular article

Good News Newspapers often refers to Christian Gospel publications that aim to pass on the 'good news' of religion. These evangelist newspapers are usually distributed on a non profit basis through local churches and community groups. Some typical examples of this genre in the UK are provided by the Christian Free Press Ltd, Good News Media and New Life Publishing. In the United ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼States there are many other 'good news' brands serving up a similar style of editorial. A favourite method employed by these publishers, in order to attract their readers, is to have a tabloid newspaper appearance, with a famous celebrity adorning the front cover with a loud splash testimonial of how religious faith and 'the good news of Jesus' has changed their lives. Current affairs issues are also given frequent coverage, but always with a Christian spin and faith based solution to woes.

#Article: Marepe (artist)
#Type: regular article

Marepe (born Marcos Reis Peixoto; 1970) is a Brazilian contemporary artist best known for his minimalist wood and metal sculptures and drawings. His artwork alludes his origins: culture and tradition of his birthplace, the concept of shortage, colonization and globalization are the artist's main approaches.  Marepe lives and works in Santo Antonio de Jesus, Brazil.

#Subtitle level 2: Education

In 1989, when Marepe had his first notable success by winning the first prize at the RecÃ´ncavo Biennale (Brazil) he refused an offer to study at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg continuing his visual arts studies at the Federal University of Bahia.

#Subtitle level 2: Work

Marepe's artwork expresses his personal perception upon his life juxtaposed with the political and socio-cultural spirit of Brazil, represented using everyday objects, local materials and events from his home based surroundings.

In 2013, during an exposition at the Inhotim Institute (Brazil) where Marepe exposed a metal sculpture, A Cabra / The Goat, his curator claimed to The New York Times that "Marepe is connected to the popular culture of Brazil, and how people represent the more rustic elements of their lives".

In Veja Meu Bem (2007), made to last just two days at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, Marepe reconstructed the atmosphere of a Brazilian funfair, installing a festival carousel and adding to it a chute of sugar-coated fruits, accessible to the viewers. The artwork was inspired by what he called "beautiful and precarious Brazil" and it was a way to bring a piece of his native country to London â€ a shift comparable to a prior installation art project, where the artist took a painted exterior wall from Santo Antonio de Jesus to the SÃ£o Paulo Art Biennial.

  Marepe's opinion about globalization of the art world::The fast pace of the contemporary world and the new demands posed by a globalized art circuit has often led artists not only to establish ephemeral relationships while carrying out their art production, but also to adapt their work to other contexts. 

Transporting ordinary objects into the world of art, the artist honours the Duchampian wave of the prÃªt-Ã -porter, but he also induces it, creating new meanings. The fact that Marepe lives in his native town influences his art; the everyday life in Brazil is Marape's source for creation: stalls, low-income mÃ©nages, metallic basins or trees trunk - are mixed in his artwork. Marepe includes these items in different universes resulting an "alterity" within the artistic world, alluding subjects as colonialism, identity issues, various differences between social classes and the antithesis between the modern and the traditional lifestyles.

Marepe renders objects which may seem useless but which are a necessity in some of the under developed areas of Brazil. In contrast with this, he calls his works "necessities". One of Marepe's artworks, Peixe Com AurÃ©ola (2012), consisted in a bicycle designed in such way it couldn't be ridden, having a wheel emerging from the seat. He also replaced the two classical wheels with a fish head in the front and a fish tail, both made of wood, in the back. Through this artwork, according to the former American news website, Examiner.com, Marepe tried to express "the dire need in his community for the type of abundance necessary to pursue greater meaning in life".

#Subtitle level 2: Brief Introduction

H.E. Dr Rashid Shaz is an ISESCO Ambassador for Dialogue of Culture among Civilizations  and a professor of English at the Aligarh Muslim University, India. Widely known as pioneer of the â€˜New Dialogueâ€, Rashid Shaz has produced some ground breaking works on Islam from an interfaith point of view. His book Ú©ÙˆÙ†ÙˆØ§ Ø±Ø¨Ø§ÛŒÛŒÙ† serves as an interfaith introduction to Islam in which he emphasises that the rabbania is the sum total of Islam, an ideological identity that embraces all the submitters to one God, especially the sublime souls among the people of the book. It was in this backdrop that in 2008 he released in Monaco an important founding document â€œCalling for a New Dialogue between Islam and Christianityâ€.

In 1994 Dr. Shaz launched from New Delhi a weekly newspaper Milli Times International that ceased publishing in the year 2001. The year 2004 witnessed the birth of yet another journal FutureIslam.com , this time an electronic one and in four major languages; English, Urdu, Arabic and Indonesian. In 2005, under the aegis ofÂ futureislam.comÂ he organized a major event in London on â€œMuslim Ummah: What Shall We do Now?â€. Some of his books have been ground breaking and pioneered a new thinking as the Islamabad based journal of Ijtihad has projected him among a few living voices of modern ilm al-kalam and some scholars at the Imam university have projected him as pioneer of a neo-rationalist school in Islam. He rejects both the nomenclatures, though. FutureIslam.com, the journal that he edits and which is being revived after the suspension of three years, is regarded today as one of the most respectable forums of civilizational dialogues and Reform Islam as acknowledged by Amirpur & Amman in their German bookÂ Der Islam am Wendepunkt: Liberale und konservative Reformer einer Weltreligion, 2006, Verlag Herder, Germany.

Some disagreements would also have had the purpose of putting pressure on the Grand Master then in office, FrÃ  Andrew Bertie, to resign their resignations by giving way to a new strong man not belonging to the nobility. On July 4, 2015, Pope Francis appointed a new prelate, Monsignor Jean Laffitte.



#Article: Herbert Brookes

Herbert Robinson Brookes (20 December 1867 - 1 December 1963) was an Australian businessman, philanthropist, and political activist. He inherited substantial holdings from his father, and served as president of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. He was involved in numerous charities, and was a major benefactor to the University of Melbourne, his alma mater. Brookes also filled various governmental positions, serving on the Board of Trade, the Tariff Board, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and briefly as the first Commissioner-General to the United States.

#Subtitle level 2: Early life

Brookes was born in Bendigo, Victoria, to Catherine Margaret (nÃ©e Robinson) and William Brookes. His younger brothers were Harold and Sir Norman Brookes, both of whom were also public figures - Harold as a businessman, and Norman as a champion tennis player. Their English-born father had arrived in Australia at the age of 18, and made a fortune from mining ventures and other endeavours. In 1878, he moved the family to Government Gums, South Australia, where for two years he oversaw the completion of part of the Central Australia Railway. Herbert assisted his father as a timekeeper and storekeeper, mixing with the adult workers. When the family moved back to Melbourne in 1881, he attended Wesley College. He later went on to the University of Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree in 1890.

#Subtitle level 2: Business career

After graduation, Brookes spent a year in Queensland working on his father's pastoral leases. He then returned to Victoria to work in the mining industry, managing a series of small mines. In 1905, Brookes moved to Melbourne to work for Austral Otis, a large engineering firm. He became a director of the company in 1912. Brookes' father died in 1910, leaving he and his siblings an estate valued at Â£172,000. He received the chairmanship of Australian Paper Mills (which his father had founded in 1882), and also managed the William Brookes & Co. pastoral holdings in Queensland and Western Australia.

He was recalled the following year to save money during the Depression. From 1932 to 1939, Brookes served on the board of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, including as vice-chairman; he was offered the chairmanship, but refused it due to his inability to secure a guarantee of independence from government control.

#Subtitle level 2: Career

#Subtitle level 3: Model Mosque: (2007-2008)

Hussain began his production career in 2007 by writing, producing, directing and presenting the Model Mosque show on the Islam Channel.

The research for the show consisted of dispatching questionnaires to over 1,000 mosques, followed by telephone interviews, and site visits. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper Hussain said â€œThere is so much disparity between mosque standards, and the show is a way for mosques to see the positive work that is already being done.â€

The show attracted some criticism from conservative Muslims because of its reality TV format, with some critics comparing it to The X-Factor. Hussain stated that the aim of the show was to show the positive side of mosques, not to criticise them. In an interview with the BBC, Islam Channel CEO Mohammed Ali Harrath said, "We believe in name-and-fame, not name-and-shame.

Participating mosques were located geographically all over the country, and the competition was won by East London Mosque.

Hussain presented the final of Model Mosque at the Global Peace and Unity (GPU) event in 2007, in-front of a live audience of 30,000 people. Judges on the Model Mosque show included Salma Yaqoob and Iqbal Saccranie. Model Mosque was positively received by the mainstream media, with BBC One, The Guardian and ABC News Australia, reporting positively on the show.

#Subtitle level 3: Faith Off (2008)

Hussain produced and directed a 2nd show for the Islam Channel titled â€œFaith Offâ€. This was a game show format where contestants from different religious backgrounds would compete for prizes. The Guardian newspaper called it â€œBritain's first interfaith game showâ€. The show was hosted by Muslim comedian and actor Jeff Mirza.

Hussain stated on the Reuters news channel that he was trying to show that there was â€œharmony amongst the different faith groupsâ€.

The format of the show included a multiple choice current affairs segment, in addition to a home or away round, when contestants could answer questions on their own faith, or the opposing team's for further points.

One of the Jewish contestants on the show, 42-year-old Danny Judelson, said: "A game show is an original idea, to say the least ... I thought it was interesting that the channel were taking seriously the opportunity to educate their audience. There's a very serious purpose behind it."

The show was well received by interfaith groups, Ethan Cole of the Christian Post wrote, "Faith Off draws contestants with religious backgrounds from Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism, and has them compete for cash prizes by answering questions on both general and religious knowledge.â€

Hussain said of the show in an interview with The Guardian "Weâ€™re living in a multi-faith, multi-cultural society, so it's about transferring the basic blocks of knowledge. Itâ€™s also about learning the similarities between religions, instead of focusing on the differences."

#Subtitle level 3: The Pakistan Floods

In 2011 Hussain wrote, produced and directed â€œThe Pakistan Floodsâ€, a TV documentary made in response to the lack of support from western governments to the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan.

The film was commissioned by Press TV and broadcast in the UK in 2011.

He produced the film for the 25th anniversary of Muslim Aid, as well as the film for the 50th anniversary of UKIM. He also produced a film in Mali for Islamic Relief with renowned scholar Imam Zaid Shakur.

In 2008 Hussain was an official media partner for the Islam Expo, an event heralded for its ability to encourage dialogue between Muslims and non Muslims.

#Subtitle level 3: One Day In The Haram

In June 2015 Hussain re-located to Saudi Arabia, specifically to film an untitled project about the Haram in Makkah.

Further filming was carried out in the Haram in February 2017, and the film One Day In The Haram is slated for release in September 2017.Â 

One Day In The Haram is the story of the Haram in Makkah as seen through the eyes of the workers. It is 90 minutes in length and structured around the 5 daily Islamic prayers.

In an interview with Arab News Hussain said â€œhe wanted to show how successfully the Haram is run, how organized its departments are, and how seriously its workers take their jobs.â€

#Article: St Peter's Church, Henfield
#Type: regular article

St Peter's Church is a Church of England parish church in the large village of Henfield, West Sussex. Placed on the site of an 8th century Saxon church also dedicated to St Peter, it was built in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, but was heavily restored and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. 

#Subtitle level 2: History

The ground of the parish of Henfield is mostly composed of Weald clay, but towards the centre of the parish are low ridges of plateau gravel lying on Lower Greensand. On one of these, near the old road that ran from Eatons, near Ashurst, to Hurstpierpoint, stands the church of St Peter, rather to the north-west of most of the villageâ€™s older buildings. The first St. Peter's Church, probably built on the same spot, was founded by thegn Waerbald and his wife Tidburg, to whom Osmund, king of Sussex, granted 15 hides of land for that purpose in the year 770.  It has been suggested that this church was a minster, i.e. that it held a community of clergymen, but this remains a disputed point. The 15 hides granted by Osmund can presumably be identified with the lands which appear after the Conquest as Stretham (or Henfield) manor, Oreham manor, Henfield park, and the rectory estate. The early history of Stretham manor, consisting of the church itself and most of the southern and central parts of Henfield parish along with outlying parts in neighbouring parishes, shows the close connection between St Peter's, Henfield and its bishops. By 1066 Stretham manor was the property of the bishopric of Selsey, and in 1086 Domesday Book records it as belonging to the bishopric of Chichester (to which the see had been moved in 1075).  The bishops of Chichester kept a house on this estate which in the later middle ages served as Henfield's main courthouse. A farmhouse comprising one wing of the original house still survives under the name Stretham Manor. A vicarage was ordained in 1219, by which date the rectory had become a prebend of Chichester Cathedral, further strengthening the links between St Peter's and its see.

The Saxon church survived at least as late as Domesday Book, but nothing now remains of it. Perhaps around 1200-1220, and certainly no later than 1250, it had been replaced by a simple nave and chancel built of Caen stone, a kind of Middle Jurassic limestone quarried in Normandy.  The chancel arch from this building can still be seen, as can two lancet windows in what is now the vestry. Two aisles to north and south were built later in the 13th century, and in the 14th century the porch and the arches separating the nave from the aisles were added. There was much further building in the 15th century: the tower, a westward extension of the nave, and north of the chancel a new chapel, known as the Parham chapel. This last may have been the work of Thomas Beckington, Prebendary of Henfield from 1438 to 1443.  In 1530 the dedication of the church, which is usually given as being to St Peter, was recorded as being to Sts Peter and Paul. In 1627 two dormer windows were added to the north aisle; those in the south aisle are of uncertain date but may be from the same period. A gallery on the south side of the church is recorded as being in place in 1718.

St Peter's and one of its churchwardens featured in a court case in 1607 involving the theft of a bell from St Leonard's Church, Aldrington, a parish church a few miles away. Aldrington parish was then depopulated and the church was ruinous, and arrangements were made to sell its bell. Although this arrived at St Peter's, "it did not travel to Henfield with the consent of the Aldrington parishioners": the churchwarden admitted helping to steal it, and "the authorities at Henfield Church admitted that they had received  of bell material" which was used to cast a new bell for the tower. They agreed to pay compensation of Â£16.5s. to Aldrington parish.

The 19th century saw extensive rebuilding of the fabric of the church. First of all the south aisle, which had been said to be badly out of repair as early as 1637, was replaced before 1833 at the expense of the notable botanist William Borrer, a local resident, and a gallery was included for the use of schoolchildren. In 1855 the tower was restored by an unknown architect. In 1870 and 1871 a large-scale restoration was undertaken to the designs of the architects William Slater and Richard Carpenter. Most of the walls were refaced with flint, the chancel was lengthened eastward and raised in height, a new south chancel chapel was built, both aisles were entirely rebuilt, the roof of the nave was opened up and new clerestory lancet windows installed.

St Peter's Church was designated a Grade II* listed building on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being "particularly important ... and of more than special interest".  In February 2001, it was one of 54 Grade II* listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Mid Sussex.  In 2008 a new stone floor was laid, under-floor heating installed, and the 19th-century pews were replaced with chairs.

#Subtitle level 2: Related buildings

The prebend is recorded in 1341 as consisting of a house and garden with 60 acres of land. About 1520 it became the property of the diocese, but a few years later in 1533 it was leased for 80 years to Thomas Bishop, lawyer to Bishop Robert Sherburne. From him the lease passed first to his son Sir Thomas Bishop, then to the second Thomas's younger son Henry Bishop, Postmaster General of England, who was temporarily deprived of it during the Commonwealth period. Parsonage House, the successor of the original prebend house, was built in the 16th century or earlier but was refronted in the 18th century; it still stands in Church Street.

A vicarage house appears in documents of 1481, 1529, 1636 and 1724, but the present vicarage was built c. 1806 and enlarged c. 1850.

In 1812 a church school for boys was opened in Henfield. Its successor, St Peter's Church of England Primary School, occupies buildings on the north-west edge of the village which were built in 1957 and extended in 1983.  

An iron mission room capable of seating 60 was built on Oreham Common in 1891, but, services there being very badly attended, it was demolished before 1909.

#Subtitle level 2: Architecture and fittings

The church of St Peter as it stands today consists of a nave with north and south aisles and transepts, a chancel flanked by a chapel to the north and a vestry to the south, a porch and a tower. The nave dates from the 13th century, though whether early or late is disputed. The chancel arch, though 13th century, was rebuilt in the 19th. The aisles and chancel are products of the 1870-1871 restoration. The 15th-century Parham chapel is remarkable for its east window, a lovely example of the Gothic style of Henry VI's reign. The tower is in a rather austere version of the Perpendicular style, "as grim", Pevsner says, "as it would be in Northumberland".

During the restoration work of 1870-1871 some murals were uncovered, the most interesting of which, found on the church's north wall, was on a heraldic subject. Medieval murals are quite common in Sussex churches, but this one was dated as late as 1694.  There was also formerly a painting of the Decalogue, Creed and Lord's Prayer with cherubs and angels, dating from 1897, which hung in the Parham chapel until the 1950s.

The church's notable fittings include an octagonal font, dated variously to the early 13th century or to the 15th century, a 14th-century iron-bound chest, and, in the Parham chapel, a reredos carved by Frank Ernest Howard with figures of the patron saints of the four countries of the United Kingdom. The chapel screen, in the arch between the Parham chapel and the north aisle, was executed by Frances E. Allen in 1969, but it incorporates 15th-century work. There are eight 18th-century bells, said to give "one of the best rings in the county". The plate is of a similar date, consisting of a salver (1704), flagon (1732), chalice (1733), and two patens and an almsdish (1753). The modern kneelers illustrate in tapestry the animal and plant life of Henfield parish in almost 300 different designs.

There are two brasses. One, in the vestry, shows Ann Kenwellmersh (d. 1633) with her hand on the head of her nine-year-old grandson Menelab Rainsford (d. 1627). The other, in the Parham chapel, is of Thomas Bishop (d. 1559), the first of the family to lease the rectory. Also in the Parham chapel is a monument to Thomas's grandson Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General. Two memorial tablets inside the church, on the right as you walk through the door from the porch, name the 60 men of the parish who died in the First World War, and the 14 who died in the Second World War.

#Subtitle level 2: Stained glass

St Peter's Church is notable for the quality of its stained glass, which includes work by some of the best-known designers in late 19th-century and early 20th-century England. In the north aisle the second window, depicting Fortitude and Charity, was produced c. 1907 by the firm of James Powell and Sons, and the first window (St Luke and St Paul) was designed by the Sussex artist Charles Eamer Kempe in 1903. The north transept's north window was made in 1928 by Kempe and Co after Kempe's death; its east window (Madonna and Child, and St Nicholas with children) by Frederick Charles Eden, a Brighton man, in 1935.  In the Parham chapel, the north window is full of local interest, its five lights depicting Lancelot Andrewes, St Richard of Chichester, St Peter (the dedicatee of the church), St Wilfrid (whom Gibbon called the Apostle of Sussex), and St Augustine of Canterbury. It was produced by Kempe and Co in 1920.  The chapel's east window, in four lights, is a 1921 work by Geoffrey Fuller Webb. It shows the Captain of the Host of the Lord appearing to Joshua before Jericho (Joshua 5:13-15), and St John the Divine writing about the Holy City. Between the chapel and the chancel are glass windows engraved with agricultural scenes, which were installed in 1969. The five-light east window of the chancel was designed by Kempe in 1874 or 1875, and shows a Nativity scene, the Crucifixion, and several saints. In the vestry, which is kept locked, is a striking, quasi-Art Nouveau depiction of Mary Magdalene over the text "She hath done what she could" (Mark 14:8). It was produced by Lowndes and Drury, with the design attributed by one authority to Mary Lowndes, by another to Isabel Lilian Gloag. According to the art historian Peter Cormack it was designed by Gloag and painted by Lowndes. An adjoining office, also locked, has the oldest stained glass in the church, a depiction of Jesus preaching the Sermon on the Mount installed in 1872. Its style suggests it is the work of Clayton and Bell. The three-light south transept window (St Oswald, St George and St Edmund) is by Kempe and Co, 1916. The south aisle's first window by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1898, shows the Annunciation. The second window, designed by Mary Lowndes and produced by James Powell and Sons in 1891, is on the theme "Suffer the little children to come unto me" (Mark 10:14). Finally the west window, which is not accessible to the public, depicts St Michael, St George and St Raphael. It was made in 1896 and is once again the work of Charles Eamer Kempe.

#Subtitle level 2: The church today

Since 1978 St Peter's, Henfield has formed part of the united benefice of Henfield with Shermanbury and Woodmancote, but it remains a distinct parish. The parish is served by a vicar, an assistant priest and an assistant curate. Holy Communion is celebrated on Sunday at 10.00 a.m., sometimes with the Book of Common Prayer liturgy and sometimes with Common Worship, except on the first Sunday of every month when there is a family-friendly service without Communion. There are also sometimes services earlier on Sunday morning, and at 6.30 on Sunday evening. Holy Communion is celebrated on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. and on Thursday at 7.15 p.m., and services are regularly conducted in two local care homes.  The church is open to visitors every day from 8.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.

#Article: Zadruga (movement)
#Type: regular article

Zadruga, Movement of Polish Nationalists Zadruga, was a Polish neopagan nationalist movement founded in 1937 by Jan Stachniuk, which published a monthly political and cultural bulletin "Zadruga". The group focused around this magazine was the most active neopagan group during the inter-War 1918-1939 period in Poland, having around 300 followers in 1939. The Zadruga movement has never become an organization with a formal membership. Its spiritual guide was Antoni Wacyk, who was promoting a return to Slavic native faith. Jan Stachniuk was promoting his ideology of culturalism, aiming at unification of Western Slavic peoples, based on the reconstruction of their original national culture and cultural strength, as opposed to the presumed anti-cultural influence of Christianity, especially of the Catholic clergy, promoting laxism, escapism, and consumption. This should prepare these nations for the inevitable confrontation with the Russian and German expanionism. Each nation should build its own strength thought its collective matrix, named zadruga after the original Slavic notion of the organization of rural communities. The Western Slavic nations should function as one centralized state with the collective ownership of land and industry, based on grass-root enthusiasm and heroism. 

During the World War II, under the German occupation, the Zadruga members first began leading an underground educational activity. In 1943 they formed a political party Stronnictwo Zrywu Narodowego, and subsequently the military organization Zryw, which in autumn 1943 joined the Home Army. Some of the Zadruga members were arrested by Gestapo, imprisoned in the Dachau and Sachsenhausen concentration camps, where they popularized the political ideas of Zadruga among other Polish prisoners. After the war, in 1945-46 some these liberated prisoners continued their educational and publishing activity in Scotland.

In 1945-47, as part of the Nationalist opposition, they were publishing "Zryw" in PoznaÅ„ and "Arkona" journals in Bydgoszcz. In 1949 all the leaders of the movement were arrested by the Communist regime, accused of collaboration with neo-Fascism and sentenced in 1952. After the amnesty in 1956, they were liberated, but did not restore the former activities, which transformed into an informal intellectual movement, concentrated in WrocÅ‚aw. The attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to restore it as an association were not successful. 

After 1989 the elements of the ideology of "Zadruga" were used by BolesÅ‚aw Tejkowski in his ideology of Polish anti-clerical nationalism of the Social-National Union (Unia SpoÅ‚eczno-Narodowa). The ideology was also propagated separately by the ToporzeÅ‚ Publishing House . Many of the former participants of the informal Zadruga intellectual groups are now members of theNational Movement (Ruch Narodowy) or of the Nacjonalistyczne Stowarzyszenie "Zadruga" . 

The foundational writings of Stachniuk and Wacyk are used now by certain Polish Slavic native faith groups, especially by the Union of Native Faith (Rodzima Wiara) and by the Association for Tradition and Culture "Niklot" (Stowarzyszenie na rzecz Tradycji i Kultury â€žNiklotâ€).

#Article: SkÃ¡lholt Cathedral
#Type: regular article

SkÃ¡lholt Cathedral (Icelandic: SkÃ¡lholtdÃ³mkirkjan) is a Church of Iceland cathedral church. The church is the official church of the Bishop of SkÃ¡lholt, currently KristjÃ¡n Valur IngÃ³lfsson. 

#Subtitle level 2: History

Even though the cathedral contains the seat of the bishop, SkÃ¡lholt is no longer a diocese with its own right. The Diocese of SkÃ¡lholt was dissolved in 1801 however it was re-established as a suffragan diocese in 1909. Thus the bishop is known as a suffragan bishop who assists the Bishop of Iceland. Nonetheless, the Bishop of SkÃ¡lholt is responsible for the cathedral affairs. 

The cornerstone of the present cathedral was laid in 1956 by Bishop SigurbjÃ¶rn Einarsson. It was built between 1956 and 1963 to commemorate the 1000 years since the diocese was founded in 1056. The cathedral was consecrated in 1963. The cathedral was built on the site of all 9 previous churches that had stood on the exact site throughout the 1000 years since the establishment of the diocese. Excavations carried out on the site prior to the building of the cathedral proved this much. Excavations unearthed several headstones of various bishops of SkÃ¡lholt including a stone coffin that included the remains of one of the bishops.  

#Subtitle level 2: Interior

The cathedral contains a total of 25 stained glass windows made by GerÃ°ur HelgadÃ³ttir. They are designed in an abstract manner and depict Christian symbolism and some of the medieval bishops of SkÃ¡lholt. The altarpiece is the work of NÃ­na TryggvadÃ³ttir amd depicts Christ coming into the cathedral with the landscape behind depicting Iceland. The pulpit dates from the 17th century and is the one used by Bishop BrynjÃ³lfur Sveinsson in 1650. 



#Article: Church of St Dyfnog, Llanrhaeadr
#Type: regular article

The Church of St Dyfnog, Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch, Denbighshire, Wales is a parish church dating from the 13th century. The church is most famous for its Tree of Jesse window which dates from 1533. The church is a Grade I listed building.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The first mentions of the church occur in the Norwich Taxatio Ecclesiastica of 1254 and the Lincolnshire Taxatio of 1291. The South chamber and the door of the tower may both date from this time. The "particularly fine enriched roofs" are later, dating from re-modellings in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Jesse window, the church's most famous feature, dates from 1533. The window is reputed to have been removed and buried during the English Civil war to protect it from destruction. It was re-instated in 1661. The church suffered at the hands of Victorian restorers; Arthur Baker's restoration of 1879-80 is described as "indifferent" by Cadw and as "inappropriate" in the Clwydd volume of The Buildings of Wales.The church remains an active parish church within the Mission Area of Denbigh.  

#Subtitle level 2: Architecture and description

The church is constructed of limestone rubble with sandstone dressings and slate roofs. It has a double nave, a South chamber and a four storey tower. The architectural historian Edward Hubbard notes the style as Perpendicular, with the possible exception of the tower door.

The interior contains a "wonderfully complete" Tree of Jesse window, described by Cadw as "the apogee of the early Tudor North Wales school of glazing". The window, showing Jesus's descent from Jesse, has been called "the finest Glass window in all Wales, exceeded by few in England". 

The church also contains a number of significant monuments to local grandees including those of Watkin Edwards Wynne and Maurice Jones, the latter "large and Baroque, (a) reclining bewigged effigy". There is also a rare carved pelican, dated 1792, shown feeding its young with its blood. The church is a Grade I listed building, the listing recording it as "an exceptionally fine late medieval church (with) the famous Jesse window".



#Article: J.H.C. Morris
#Type: regular article

John Humphrey Carlisle Morris  DCL (18 February 1910 - 29 September 1984) was a British legal scholar, best known for his contributions to the conflict of laws.

#Subtitle level 2: Early life

John Morris was born in Wimbledon on 18 February 1910. He was educated at Charterhouse School where he was elected to a Holford Scholarship to read history at Christ Church, Oxford, although after two terms he switched to study law.  He graduated with first class honours degrees in the Final Honour School and subsequently on the BCL. He was elected to an Eldon Law Scholarship, but was unsuccessful in his quest for the Vinerian Scholarship.

In 1934 he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn, but he did not enjoy legal practice. In 1936 he left to return to Oxford at a tutor in law at Magdalen College, Oxford where (with the exception of one year as a visiting fellow at Harvard) he would spend the remainder of his professional life.  During his brief career at the Bar, he did appear on one occasion before the House of Lords in Government of India v Taylor 1955 AC 491.

In 1939 he married Mercy Jane Kinch. They never had children.

#Subtitle level 2: War service

At the outbreak of World War II Morris was too old to enlist, so instead joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was posted initially to the Faroe Islands to defend against possible attack, and was later involved in allied training operations preparing for D-Day.

#Subtitle level 2: Academic contributions

After arriving at Magdalen, Morris was credited with transforming the teaching of law at the college, including the recruitment of key academics such as Rupert Cross. Two students who claimed to have been particularly influenced by him was Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Ronald Dworkin.  Unusually, he never held a chair at Oxford. He was reportedly offered the post of Vinerian Professor of English Law in 1954, but declined in favour of his colleague, Rupert Cross.

He is most famous for his contributions to private international law. Whilst at Harvard he published a notable article in Harvard Law Review on the subject, and he taught the subject for decades to BCL students at Oxford. But he is most famous as general editor of what is now as Dicey Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws. However he also published the 9th edition of Theobald on Wills and Cases on Private International Law. He also wrote extensively on property law.

Morris was a longstanding critic of the double actionability rule in tort, but did not live long enough to see the rule relaxed by the Privy Council in Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA 1995 1 AC 190.

Upon his retirement Morris was honoured with a book published in dedication to him: Contemporary Problems in the Conflict of Law: Essays in Honour of John Humphrey Carlile Morris.  The foreword was written by Lord Scarman, who expressed himself as indebted to Morris for his guidance during his (Scarman's) time as Chairman of the Law Commission.



#Article: Glory Academy, Kamakura
#Type: regular article

Glory Academy, Kamakura, Japan, is an all-boys, junior and senior high school, founded in 1947 by the Society of Jesus in the Catholic Church. It has as its patron the Jesuit St. Aloysius Gonzaga and takes as its motto that of the Jesuits: "For the greater glory of God." The name of the school given here is a rendering of the Japanese name "Eiko Gakuen."

#Subtitle level 2: History

The Jesuits, founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1540, came to Japan in the 16th century and founded a school in Arima, during the Azuchi period, which was closed after the banishment of the Jesuits. They returned to Japan and established Sophia University in Tokyo in 1913, Taisei/Sophia Fukuoka Junior and Senior High School in 1932, Rokko Junior and Senior High School in Kobe in 1937, Glory Academy Middle School in 1947 in Taura, Kanagawa Prefecture, and later Hiroshima Academy Junior and Senior High School in 1956. 

In 1950 education at Glory was extended through high school. By 1953 there were 473 in the junior high school and 273 in the high school. In 1957 Glory became independent of the Sophia University Foundation. In 1964 the school moved from Taura to its present, 27.4 acre site at Oboe, Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. The German Jesuit Professor from Sophia University Gustav Foss was the founding principal and remained in the job for 30 years.  

Art and technology classrooms were completed in 1992. On the 50th anniversary in 1997, a new gymnasium and baseball stadium were added.  

In April 2016 four Jesuit academies joined into a new corporation, called the Sophia College Corporation, to consolidate their efforts and strengthen their Jesuit identity, as through common teacher training. The corporation is centered at Sophia University, which lends its assistance to the schools. In this way, with the declining number of Jesuits, the Jesuit influence is more likely to endure. These schools are Hiroshima Academy, Rokko School, Sophia Academy, and Glory Academy, along with Elisabeth University of Music.

#Subtitle level 2: Education

In the Jesuit tradition, the school endeavors to train "men for others." There is heavy emphasis on learning and discipline. Ethics class is compulsory but religious and biblical studies are optional. Considerable emphasis is placed on English language studies.

The school is one of the most demanding in Kanagawa prefecture and all of Japan. More than 3,000 out of 10,000 graduates have attended the University of Tokyo, an Imperial University.  From 2008 to 2013, of 1076 graduates 350 attended the University of Tokyo and 98 its medical school. Also, 63 went on to Hitotsubashi University, 39 to Tokyo Institute of Technology, 107 to other public universities, and 387 to private universities.

International experiences are offered on a regular basis with Sacred Heart School - Ateneo de Cebu in the Philippines and with Boston College in the United States. 

#Subtitle level 2: Extracurricular activities

All junior high school students are required to participate in some club activities. The high school soccer team has twice made it to the national high school championship. representing Kanagawa prefecture. The baseball team represented the South Kanto region in the national high school softball championships in 2003. The gymnastics department won the Double Dutch (jump rope) world tournament in 2014. 

Extracurricular activities in which students excel include the International Science Olympic Games (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology). The school won the 2015 nationwide high school debate tournament (in English) and participated in the world competition. In 2003, students won the national high school quiz championship. Student activities include a brass band. 

Masses and other religious activities are offered throughout the year. Voluntary service programs carry students to a rehabilitation hospital and a children's home.

#Subtitle level 2: Christianity

Like the rest of France, Paris has been predominantly Roman Catholic since the early Middle Ages, though religious attendance is now low. A majority of Parisians are still nominally Roman Catholic. According to 2011 statistics, there are 106 parishes and curates in the city, plus separate parishes for Spanish, Polish and Portuguese Catholics. There are an additional 10 Eastern Orthodox parishes, and bishops for the Armenian and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. In addition there are eighty male religious orders and 140 female religious orders in the city, as well as 110 Catholic schools with 75,000 students.

The principal Roman Catholic church in Paris is the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, the seat of the Archbishop of Paris. There are two officially recognised pilgrimage sites in Paris: the Basilique du SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur de Montmartre and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. Cardinal AndrÃ© Vingt-Trois became the Archbishop of Paris in March 2005.

Almost all Protestant denominations are represented in Paris, with 74 evangelical churches from various denominations, including 21 parishes of the United Protestant Church of France and two parishes of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints. There are several important churches for the English-speaking community: the American Church in Paris, founded in 1814, was the first American church outside the United States; the current church was finished in 1931. The Saint George's Anglican Church in the 16th arrondissement is the principal Anglican church in the city.

#Subtitle level 2: Islam

The Grand Mosque of Paris, the oldest mosque in Paris, was dedicated in 1926. It was funded by the French government and built to honour the 38,000 soldiers from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco who died fighting for France in the First World War.

In 2011 there were nineteen large mosques within the city limits of Paris, all except the Grand Mosque located in the outer arrondissements of the city, as well as hundreds of small prayer rooms. The number of mosques doubled between 1991 and 2011.

#Subtitle level 2: Judaism

During the Middle Ages, Paris was a centre of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.

#Subtitle level 2: Buddhism and Hinduism

The Pagode de Vincennes Buddhist temple, near Lake Daumesnil in the Bois de Vincennes, is the former Cameroon pavilion from the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. It hosts several different schools of Buddhism, and does not have a single leader. It shelters the biggest Buddha statue in Europe, more than 9 m high. There are two other small temples located in the Asian community in the 13th arrondissement. A Hindu temple, dedicated to Ganesh, on Rue Pajol in the 18th arrondissement, opened in 1985.



#Article: Ahmed ibn Merwan
#Type: regular article

Ahmed ibn Merwan was a lieutenant in Kerbogha's army at the time of the First Crusade.

After the  capture of Antioch by the Crusaders, Ahmed was entrusted with maintaining control of the still Turkish-held citadel within the city. Following the Battle of Antioch, in which Kerbogha's forced were crushed, Ahmed offered to surrender the citadel to the Crusaders. However, as he refused to allow any prince's banner but Bohemond's to be flown over the citadel, it appears as though he had maintained a secret truce with Bohemond in the effect of a Crusader victory against Kerbogha. Following the transfer of the citadel to the Christians, Ahmed joined the ranks of the Crusaders and even converted to Christianity.

#Article: Ntsikana
#Type: regular article

Ntsikana (born 1780-1821) was a Christian Xhosa prophet, evangelist and hymn writer who is regarded as one of the first Christians to translate Christian ideas and concepts into terms understandable to a Xhosa audience.

#Subtitle level 2: Personal Life

Ntsikana was born around 1780 to Gaba, a councillor to the western amaRharhabe king, Ngqika and his junior wife Nonabe in the Thyume valley, north of Alice. Ntsikana who belonged to his father's clan, the Cirha clan, was brought up around his mother's kinsmen until he was about five or six. His father sent for him having secured his rights by paying a beast for the child's maintenance since infancy. His father's great wife, Noyiki, who had a daughter but no sons, adopted Ntsikana who therefore became Gabaâ€™s heir. From this time, Ntsikana made the Great Place in the Thyume valley, north of Alice his home. Ntsikana's first contact with Christianity coincided with his customary Xhosa initiation in 1800. In 1799, Johannes van der Kemp, a missionary of the London Missionary Society, arrived among the western amaXhosa and was permitted to set up his camp near to Ngqikaâ€™s Great Place. Van der Kemp soon became an attraction both for the king and his people, and in the year that he remained among them they had many opportunities to hear him preach and discuss with him his new teaching. When he left in 1800 van der Kemp could not claim any converts but he may have had an influence on Ntsikana.Ntsikana married two young women, Nontsonta and Nomanto, and settled between the Kat River district and the Peddie district in 1811. Later, he and his family moved to Gqore in the Kate River district. After converting to Christianity, Ntsikana divorced his wife Nomanto. Ntsikana died in Thwatwa in 1821.

#Subtitle level 2: Christian work

From his first contact with Christianity through van der Kemp to 1815 Ntsikana led a normal life. His first spiritual experience was when he was at the kraal looking at his prized ox, Hulushe. As he watched, he saw a patch of light, brighter than ordinary sunlight, illuminating the hide of the animal. Ntsikana asked his companion, a young herdsman for corroboration but the young man denied seeing anything. Later that day, Ntsikana participated in Umdudo (traditional wedding dance). During his performance, a gale-force wind started and when he stopped, it ceased. When he stood up again to dance, the gale-force winds returned with lightning and thunder. Ntsikana did not fully commit to the Christian religion until he met James Read and Joseph Williams who were travelling with Dyani Tshatshu, son of Xhosa chief from the Buffalo River, near Fort Beaufort on April 1816. Read and Williams offered further scriptural teaching to Ntsikana, before inviting him to travel with them back to Bethelsdorp when they returned. But such a journey was impossible, neither his chiefs nor the British authorities would allow him to travel into the colony, so the missionaries advised him to remain where he was until Williams could return to establish the new mission station and offer him further instruction. When Williams returned he found Ntsikana had patiently waited for him and had moved his family from Thyume to establish his home in the Mankazana hills, close to where the new mission station was built. Each Saturday, with his complete household, he visited Williams to receive instruction and stayed until Sunday to join in worship. Now a fully converted Christian, Ntsikana divorced one of his wives Nomanto and denounced polygamy. In 1818, Williams passed away, and Ntsikane became the leader, establishing Christian communities in the Mankazana Valley and at Burnshill, Somerset East, Debe Nek, King Williamâ€™s Town and Mgwali. Ntsikanaâ€™s Christian influence touched the lives of leaders such as King Ngqika, and his counsellor, Old Soga, the father of Tiyo Soga, and Tiyoâ€™s older brother, Festiri. 

#Subtitle level 2: Conflict between traditional religion & Christianity

Ntsikana experienced an internal conflict between indigenous belief system (Inkolo yakwaNtu) and the foreign belief system (Inkolo yaseMzini)- Christianity. As a child he did not agree to be baptised by missionaries but became a Christian leader in life. He also acknowledged that Christianity demanded exclusivity meaning that he had to do away with Xhosa traditional belief systems. Ntsikana also had a rivalry with Makhanda who is also known as Nxele, a prophet under chief Ndlambe who was based in the area now known as Grahamstown. Nxele rejected Christianity and western innovations, resisting the arrival of Europeans on the frontier during the Frontier Wars. Nxele called for the worshiping of Xhosa God, Mdalidiphu, while Ntsikana worshipped Thixo, the god of Christians. Referring to Nxele, Ntsikana once said "uNxele ubuquqekile, ubalahlekisilani abantu?" (Nxele has turned upside down, why does he mislead people?) 

#Subtitle level 2: Music

Ntsikana also composed Christian hymns in isiXhosa which included â€œIntsimbiâ€ (Ntsikanaâ€™s Bell),â€œDalibom (Life-Creator), â€œIngoma enqukuvaâ€ (Round Hymn) and â€œUlo Tixomkuluâ€ (â€œThou Great Godâ€ - the Great Hymn). 

#Subtitle level 2: Legacy

Ntsikana is regarded as one of the first Christians who tried to adapt Christianity to African culture.

#Article: The Works of Alan Watts
#Type: regular article

#Subtitle level 2: Introduction

Alan Watts was an orator and philosopher of the 20th century. He spent time reflecting on Personal Identity and Higher Consciousness. According to the critic Erik Davis, his "writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanising lucidity."These works are not accessible in the same way as his many books. 

#Subtitle level 2: Lectures

The following lectures can all be obtained at alanwatts.orghttp://www.alanwatts.org.

#Subtitle level 3: Is this life a dream?

Watts proposes a thought experiment of imagining that one has total control over the content of each night's dreams. He uses this thought experiment to make a case for the self as the ultimate reality.

#Subtitle level 3: What if Money were no object?

Watts argues that there is less difference than generally supposed between what one would want to do if money were no object, and what one should do under actual circumstances. He proposes that the question "What do I desire?" should be given greater emphasis, even under actual circumstances.

#Subtitle level 3: The mind

Watts makes a case for quieting the mind by leaving it alone. He argues that we are "addicted to thoughts" and want to avoid ourselves, and that this quest for self-avoidance leads to a "vicious circle" of worry.

#Article: Hiroshima Academy Junior and Senior High School
#Type: regular article

Hiroshima Academy Junior and Senior High SchoolÂ in Hiroshima,Â Japan, isÂ an integrated middle and high that has provided for boys aÂ JesuitÂ and Catholic education since 1956.

#Subtitle level 2: History

In 1956 the SocietyÂ of Jesus established this as its third junior-senior high school in Japan. The school follows the broad objectives of Ignatian pedagogy, personal care for each student as an individual, and teamwork. It pursues the objective of training "men for and with others."

In 1956 the Hiroshima Junior High School building was completed and the school opened. By 1958 the office, high school, science, and residence buildings were completed and the high school was certified for opening in 1959. In 1962 a gymnasium and auditorium were completed. In 1982 the West Building was added, along with the small gymnasium. 

Early on the school ran a dormitory and recruited from all over Japan. In the late 1980s the dormitory was closed and the building demolished. In 1988Â the name ofÂ Francis Xavier, the patron saint of the school,Â was given to a new dome-type gymnasium built by Takenaka Corporation,Â which also built theÂ Tokyo Dome; this gymÂ received the Hiroshima City Excellence Building Award inÂ 1989. In 1995 a new science building was completed. In 2005 for the 50th anniversary a commemorative monument was erected at the Eastern gate. The year 2015 saw the completion of the Pedro Arrupe Memorial Auditorium and St. Francis Assisi Church. 

An athletic festival, a cultural festival, and club activities are integral to the program. This has not hurt the efforts of graduates to secure entrance to universities;The school ranks thirteenth in the nation in student results on examinations given by nine prominent universities. As of 2014 the school had 9000 graduates.

Since 2016, Jesuit schools in Japan have joined together in the Sophia College Corporation to maximize Jesuit influence in a time when Jesuit numbers are declining. Workshops for teachers are sponsored to preserve what should be distinctive about the Jesuit school. While leaving school administration and management intact, the new corporation assists the following schools: Sophia University and its Junior College Department with the Junior and Senior High School,Â Elisabeth University of Music, Glory Academy,Â Rokko School, and Hiroshima Academy. Eliabette University ofÂ MusicÂ accepts from Hiroshima Academy teaching apprentices every year.

#Subtitle level 2: School life

#Subtitle level 3: Location

The school is located on a promontory with a good view of the old city. It is a steep climb up the hill from the Hiroshima Electric Railway Miyajima LineÂ Furue StationÂ orÂ Takasu Station. For bus users it takes about 30 minutes to walk from the Nishi Hiroshima station.

#Subtitle level 3: School day

Each year has 4 classes of about 45 students. There is no cafeteria; students bring box lunches which they consume in their homerooms. Club activities are held for an hour after the school day, and at the weekly assembly club awards are announced. An exercise period of 15 minutes each morning is accompanied by gymnastics music. 

#Subtitle level 3: Uniform

The summer uniform is a white, short-sleeved shirt with the Jesuit crest on the pocket.Â The winter uniform is a long-sleeve shirt and jacket. From 2010,Â there are Roman numeralsÂ representing the grade on the right collar andÂ the emblem of the school chapter of Hiroshima Academy on the left collar.Â The emblem representing the grade is gold for high school and silver for junior high school students.Â  For carrying books, formerly only wrapping cloth (Furoshiki) was permitted; from this comes the name of the school magazine. Since 2011 school bags have been permitted. Students switch to simpler dress and slippers once at school.

#Subtitle level 2: Activities

#Subtitle level 3: Committees

There are a number of student committees that serve under the Student Council, and are elected each February. There is a committee for culture, physical education, morals, publicity, and service.Â Independent of the student council are the beautification and library committees.

#Article: Ivo FÃ¼rer
#Type: regular article

Jakob Andreas Ivo FÃ¼rer (born 20 April 1930) is a Swiss prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Bishop of St. Gallen from 1995 to 2005.

#Subtitle level 2: Life

Ivo FÃ¼rer was born in Gossau, Switzerland, and studied catholic theology at Innsbruck University and canon law in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where in 1957 he earned a doctorate in canon law. He was ordained a priest on 3 April 1954. He was a chaplain in Herisau from 1958 to 1963 and in AltstÃ¤tten from 1963 to 1967. He became Bishop's Secretary in St. Gallen in 1967 and then Bishop's Vicar in 1969. In 1971 he helped found the Working Community of Christian Churches in Switzerland, a body of the National Council of Churches. In 1972 he was the president of the Swiss and diocesan synods. He was General Secretary of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe from 1977 to 1995. He became a cathedral deacon in 1991.

FÃ¼rer was elected bishop of St. Gallen on 28 March 1995 and appointed to that position the next day by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated a bishop on 5 June 1995 by Bishop Otmar MÃ¤der with Bishops Henri Salina and Karl Lehmann as co-consecrators.

In 1995 FÃ¼rer and Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini of Milan guided the formation of group of about a dozen like-minded cardinals and bishops who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen to discuss church reforms, including the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy, and sexual morality. They differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave. Though some media reports discussed this as a conspiracy, FÃ¼rer said in 2015 that it was a circle of friends (Freundeskreise) that at first discussed church policy and then also candidates for the papacy as the health of Pope John Paul II declined. He said it last met in 2006.

As a member of the Swiss Bishops' Conference he was responsible for the Deaconate and Relief Services. Beginning in 1997 headed the Secretariat of the Council of European Bishops' Conferences since 1997.

He submitted his resignation on his 75th birthday, and Pope Benedict XVI accepted it on 16 October 2005.

In 2005, the University of Fribourg awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his contribution to implementing the principles of the Second Vatican Council in Switzerland and in Europe.

In 2007 the University of St. Gallen named him an Honorary Senator for "his important contribution towards the promotion of openness and tolerance across the borders of denominations and cultures".

From 1998 to 2009 he served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Fastenopfer, a Roman Catholic charity based in Lucerne that fights hunger and poverty and promotes the development of a sustainable way of life.

#Article: Rokko Junior and Senior High School
#Type: regular article

Rokko Junior and Senior High School in Kobe City, HyÅgo Prefecture, Japan, a Catholic school founded in 1937, was the first Jesuit secondary school in Japan. It offers an integrated middle and high school education for boys and does not recruit at the high school level.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The Society of Jesus had opened Sophia University in 1913. Its next educational venture was Rokko middle school in 1937. With the completion of a wooden building it was named Rokko Junior High School in 1938. It accepted 12-year-olds for a 5-year program leading to the secondary school degree. There were 15 on the staff and 135 first-year pupils in 1938. The Hansen flood in 1938 damaged the building and grounds. In 1941 a four-storyÂ reinforced concreteÂ building was completed.

Amidst the war crisis of 1945, in April classes were interrupted but students were encouraged to study privately. The school was damaged by an air raid that hit Kobe University. The war ended on August 13 and classes resumed in September. The following years saw numerous adjustments in the junior/middle school program. The school continues to follow the seven-year, pre-World War II system.

In 1950 the school foundation was renamed Rokko Academy School. Construction continued through the '60s and '70s: an auditorium and gymnasium (1957), Mount Tate camp (1961), building expansion (1965), science building (1966), 36-km walking course (1967), swimming pool (1968), Kumihama beach school building (1971), annex and chapel (1974). In 1976 the baseball club won the 31st National (Wakasugi,Â Saga Prefecture) championship. Further improvements: TateyamaÂ HutteÂ (1979), clubhouse and archery field (1981), new auditorium and completion of gymnasium (1987). Trips to India began in 1985, a student training institute in 1988, New Zealand language training in 1992. In 2010 a temporary school building was utilized as the old one was replaced with a new one occupied in 2012. A camp at Maejima, Okinawa, replaced the one at Kumihama in 2017. 

In April 2016 five Jesuit academies joined into a new corporation, called the Sophia Academy Corporation, to consolidate their efforts and strengthen their Jesuit identity, as through common programs for teachers. The corporation is centered at Sophia University, which will lend its assistance to the schools. In this way, with the declining number of Jesuits, the Jesuit influence is more likely to endure.Â These schools areÂ Hiroshima Academy,Â Rokko Academy,Â Sophia Academy, Taizon Academy, and Glory Academy, along withÂ Elisabeth University of Music. 

The school is situated on a promontory overlooking Kobe and Seto Inland Sea. It is a 25-minute walk from Rokko station onÂ the Hankyu RailwayÂ line, and a 10 and 15 minute walk from two Kobe city bus stops.

The alumni join together in the Rokko Friends Association.

Gymnastics are included in the program during the winter months. Students assist with the cleaning of the school. A sports festival is held in June, third-year students attend Tateyama camp in July, and they along with second year high do community service in August. A visit to India program is run every other year. A Cultural Festival is held in September, Extracurricular Learning in October, and Walking Competition in November.

#Article: David Assarson
#Type: regular article

Berndt David Assarsson (born January 14, 1892 in Lund - died December 31, 1955 in Helsingborg) was a Swedish Catholic priest in Helsingborg and Stockholm, monsignor, historical author and psalmist. His efforts for the development of Roman Catholicism in Sweden were significant and in Denmark he is famous for his efforts for a reassessment of SkÃ¥neland's history.

#Subtitle level 2: Family Background and Career

Assarsson was born in Lund in 1892 as the son of professor of jurisprudence Pehr Assarsson and Gustafva Flensburg, and he was Lutheran Bishop Wilhelm Flensburg's grandson, as well as brother of Vilhelm Assarsson, a Swedish diplomat.

Assarsson became a Bachelor of Arts at Lund University in 1912. He started to study theology here and soon converted to Roman Catholicism in the same year and entered in the Jesuit Order in Ordrup, Denmark. He studied further at the Jesuit Priest Seminary in Innsbruck and was ordained priest in 1917. Assarsson then became a chaplain at Saint Eric Catholic Church in Stockholm and became the bishop's secretary. He also remained in office after bishop Albert Bitter left and bishop Johannes MÃ¼ller took over. In 1927 Assarsson was appointed permanent chaplain of the church and became in the same year a Chamberlain papal of nobility with the title of Monsignor. He was also the first priest church of Saint Clement's Catholic Church in Helsingborg.

#Subtitle level 2: Author and Editor

He wrote the book of the Fathers Church: A program (1918), which was a missionary representation of Catholic faith and a backdrop of what he considered prejudices and mistakes in the Swedish public's assessments of it. The book title borrowed from a psalm from Lutheran bishop Johan Fredrik Eklund, but appealed specifically to the Catholic Church. In 1920 he agreed to start to edit the Catholic magazine Credo, and became its editor till 1937. He was later also involved in the Catholic Academic Association Academic Catholicum.

Assarsson was the editor of Psalms for the Church in 1937, the first attempt to make a Catholic hymn book related to the Swedish hymn tradition. In 1950, according to the same principles, he edited a new version of the Cecilia psalm book, which is the official hymn book of Stockholm's catholic poems (covering the whole of Sweden). He reaffirmed the English Cardinal John Henry Newman's Psalm in 1922, "Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom" to "Light, Light, Light, Dark World," which is also found in the Church of Sweden's hymn today.

#Subtitle level 2: Catholic activist

During the controversy about the rather negative representation of the Catholic faith in Swedish school books, he wrote to the bishop Bitter in the back a Catholic schoolbook attachment that was distributed to public schools across the country. This initiative prompted a great resurrection in the Swedish press, and with few exceptions was rejected everywhere. It was argued that the Swedish schools had to remain confessional and found that the Swedish textbooks gave a confidently colored look of Catholicism. The polemic anti-Catholic newspapers on the occasion was the strongest since the 1890s; Even though the authorities rejected the Catholic views, it came from Swedish Social Democratic Party, some more comprehensible comments, and later published textbooks were somewhat muted in their characteristics.

He also committed himself to the Swedish ban on the creation of Catholic monasteries at the same time, referring to public statements about freedom of religion, and to Norway and Denmark admitted to such monasteries.

His other important works were The SkÃ¥nska problem", published by Credos FÃ¶rlag, Stockholm in 1923, "SkÃ¥neland's history in SkÃ¥neland's schools" in 1949, distributed by Killberg's Bookstore in Helsingborg. He was also editor of the Roman-Catholic Swedish-language Psalm Book Cecilia published in 1950.

Assarson also committed himself to the celebration of the Saint Ansgar, which helped to strengthen the national roots of Swedish Catholicism. This happened several years before the Swedish Church start to celebrate Ansgarsfeiringen, which might be a reaction to the celebrations of this "Nordic apostle" by the Catholics as their own.

#Subtitle level 2: Historian

In addition to his ecclesiastical work, Assarsson is also known for his efforts that SkÃ¥nelanden's history should be reproduced with focus on the Danish past of the region and the tough disappearance of the region after the Roskilde peace in 1658. In his time, Swedish history books ignored the Danish past, the SkÃ¥ne countries disappeared as unproblematic and did not mention Swedish attacks against the people of the country. Assarsson was appalled for his views in Swedish academic circles, but continued his lecture and writing. His main work became the SkÃ¥ne problem (1923), emphasizing the importance of SkÃ¥ne's history being considered in a Scandinavian perspective and taking into account the Danish background of the country. Subsequently, he published SkÃ¥neland's history in SkÃ¥neland's schools (1949), which was sent to all schools in the region as a supplement to the historically incorrect history of his opinion. Assarsson's efforts led to an increased interest in the SkÃ¥ne country's Danish history and inspired later Swedish-critical historians within the SkÃ¥neland Movement.

#Article: Monastery Agia Triada, Sparmou
#Type: regular article

The monastery Agia Triada, Sparmou (Greek ÎœÎ¿Î½Î® Î‘Î³Î¯Î±Ï‚ Î¤ÏÎ¹Î¬Î´Î±Ï‚ Î£Ï€Î±ÏÎ¼ÏŒÏ…, Moni Agias Triadas Sparmou) is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.

#Subtitle level 2: Location

The monastery is situated in the west of Mount Olympus at a height of 990 m near the municipality of Elassona.

#Subtitle level 2: History

The exact date of the foundation is not known. Records, however, prove that the monastery was inhabited since at least 1386. It is aÂ stauropegic monastery, subordinated directly to theÂ Patriarch of ConstantinopleÂ (Istanbul).

The monastery's heyday began in the early 17th century, with its climax in the second half of the 18th century. The church was renovated in 1633. The oldest, very well-preserved icons come from this period. The cells of the monks were completed around 1739. The monastery became self-sufficient and had the financial resources to engage in external affairs. The most difficult years were these of the Ottoman reign.

The monastery was one of the liturgical schools of Orthodox Christianity as well as schools in Thessaloniki, Constantinople or Venice. Particularly educated monks not only ensured that the Greek language remained alive, but also educated the population. A library and a study room were set up, the bookbinding workshop was practiced by experienced monks from the 17th to the 19th century. Many of the manuscripts and books of that period were saved and are located in the Monastery of Panagia Olympiotissa. Some examples are exhibited in the museum.

During the Greek independence war against Ottoman rule the monastery supported the Greek fighters. Because of its location, far from the Turkish administration in Elassona, the monks could act relatively freely. They hid fighters and ammunition, cared for clothes and provisions.

From the middle of the 19th century the slow decline began, and in the second decade of the 20th century the last monks left the monastery. For about 80 years it was closed. After the introduction of the Metropolitan of Elassona, Basileios, the reconstruction began. In 2000, the first monks once again moved into the monastery.

#Subtitle level 2: The monastery

A tower overlooks the high exterior walls, which are interrupted only by small, barred windows on the upper floors. In the northern part, four powerful retaining walls reinforce the statics of the outer wall, which is about one meter thick. The ground plan is a pentagon, the church (Katholikon) is the central building. The monks' cells and other rooms like the refectory are laid out arround the church. The wooden entrance door is covered with iron and is very stable.

To the inside of the monastery, the rooms of the second storey are supported by columns. Architecturally this way colonnades are formed, surrounding the church. Benches invite the visitor to rest. From the colonnades are the entrances to the museum and the small shop of the monks, as well as to the areas not accessible to the visitor of the monastery.

A small, very old well on the south side, donates holy water. In the south-west you can find the semantron and the bell-tower of the monastery. By hitting the semantron with a hammer, the monks are called to prayer.

Four chapels belong to the property, of which the chapel of Saint Haralambus is located on the site of the monastery. The Chapel of All Saints, the Chapel of the High Sacred Theotokus and the Chapel dedicated to John the Baptist are outside the grounds.

#Subtitle level 2: The church

The church is 23 meters long, seven meters wide and the external walls are one meter thick. It is a simple, straight building, covered with natural stones and bricks. It consists of the antechamber, the church room and the altar room accessible only to the priests.

The small windows lay the paintings, the carvings, the icons in a half-dark. All the walls are painted with biblical motifs or motifs of saints. The ceiling is made of wood and is shaped into different patterns, painted in different colors. Several chandeliers with wax candles hang from the ceiling. They are decorated with porcelain bowls and ostrich eggs. The floor is made of marble with inlays.

The door to the altar room was adorned with gilded wood carvings and icons. The carvings of the iconostasis are pure craftsmanship. Some of the icons are more recent because the old originals were stolen.

#Subtitle level 2: The museum

On quite a few square meters many exhibits are shown. Precious robes, the oldest icons of the monastery from the year 1633 and books, which were partly bound here. Old silver vessels used during the liturgy, precious embroidery and documents, which are witnesses of the monastery's history, are exhibited.

St. Ignatius of Loyola College, East Timor, is a coeducational, six-year secondary school opened by the Society of Jesus in 2013 near the capital city of Dili. 

#Subtitle level 2: History

#Subtitle level 3: Early efforts

Jesuits came to East Timor in 1897 and built Sacred Heart Church in Soibada and ColÃ©gio Nuno Ãlvares, a school for boys, when this was a Portuguese colony; it remains 98.6% Catholic. They left in 1910 when all religious were expelled from Portuguese colonies, and were absent for some decades. Upon returning they ran two minor seminaries, St. Francis Xavier in Dare and Our Lady of FÃ¡tima in Lahane until 2000 when priests of the Catholic Diocese of Dili took these over. They also ran St. Joseph's High School for the Diocese of Dili from 1993 until 2011, when the diocese resumed control of it. Jesuits stood by the people in their independence struggle and two Jesuits were killed in September 1999; they are seen as martyrs, Frs. Tarcisius Dewanto and Karl Albrecht.

#Subtitle level 3: Founding of Loyola

After 2011 the Jesuits turned their attention to opening two of their own schools on a common campus near Kasait, not far from Dili: ColÃ©gio Santo InÃ¡cio de LoiolÃ¡ and teacher education Instituto SÃ£o JoÃ£o de Brito. In 2013 Loyola opened with 86 seventh-grade students. It offers a six-year junior-senior high school program and is coeducational. Principal Fr. Plinio Martins insists on the parents' continuing responsibility to assist in their child's education. As a Jesuit school, its aim was expressed by the Jesuit Father general in 1986, to form â€œthe well-rounded person who is intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving and committed to doing justice in generosity to the people of God.â€ The school's motto is that of the Society of Jesus: For the greater glory of God. In light of the country's hard-fought independence struggle with Indonesia which succeeded in 2002, the Jesuits propose "to form critical, competent, and caring leaders, attentive to and shaped by values derived from the Ignatian tradition, the Catholic faith, and the cultural context of Timor-Leste." A video that conveys the spirit of the College is accessible online. 

#Subtitle level 3: Collaborative effort

The school integrates with other Jesuit works in the new country: a mission parish with secondary school and health care program in Railaco, a public service Audiovisual Production House, and Jesuit Social Service Timor-Leste which fosters volunteerism, strengthens communities, and facilitates networking.

#Article: Roman tomb in Brestovik
#Type: regular article

Roman tomb in Brestovik (Ð Ð¸Ð¼ÑÐºÐ° Ð³Ñ€Ð¾Ð±Ð½Ð¸Ñ†Ð° Ñƒ Ð‘Ñ€ÐµÑÑ‚Ð¾Ð²Ð¸ÐºÑƒ) is an ancient tomb, dating from c. 300, which was discovered in 1895 in Brestovik, today a suburban village of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Though evidence points to the tomb of a wealthy local, popular belief is that the "martyrs of Singidunum", Hermylus and Stratonicus, were buried inside. As one of the most important monuments from the Roman period, the tomb is protected since 1948.

#Subtitle level 2: Location

The tomb is situated in the village of Brestovik in Belgrade's municipality of Grocka, on the locality of VukaÅ¡inova crkva. It is dug into the hill of Zlatno brdo ("Golden hill").

#Subtitle level 2: Discovery and explorations

The tomb was discovered by accident in 1895. The owner of the lot, VukaÅ¡in MilosavljeviÄ‡, was planting seedlings in his plum orchard, when he hit the arch of the vault with his spade. He notified the authorities and in September 1895 , the curator of the National Museum in Belgrade and founder of the archaeology in Serbia, was dispatched to the site. He conducted the excavations and uncovered the entire tomb. It was conserved and protected in 1905, while the excavations have been done in 1955 and 1964. In 1964 the tomb was adapted the way it looks today and was open for visitors as the stone stairway was built to make the access easier.

#Subtitle level 2: Characteristics

The structure was built in the late 3rd or an early 4th century. It is partially dug into the slope of the hill on which the modern village cemetery is today. The tomb is oriented in the east-west direction with the entrance being on the eastern side. It is approached by an elongated, 4 m entry section, which is cut into the slope. The tomb was built from crushed stone, river pebble and bricks, all connected with the Roman lime plaster made with volcanic sand, and itself consists of three rooms:

	 porch; separated by the entry section by four pillars, it was paved with the six-sided bricks. It is connected with the central room by the door and stairs, as the porch is 1 m higher.

	 central room; it has two side apsides, on the north and south, and was also paved with the six-sided bricks. The walls were covered with frescoes, which fainted completely. The room was also ornamented with the marble statues and two figures of lions lying down. Two sculptures represented death geniuses (in the form of boys mourning the deceased) and at least one was of a sad Cupid, a winged boy sitting on a pedestal, while the lyons "guarded" the burial chamber. In one of the apsides was the life-sized sculpture of the Roman soldier (lacking the head) and a bust in Roman military clothing, which points that he was either a military commander or a high ranked clerk who was awarded with an estate. It is suggested that the room was used for sacrificial gifts to the departed. It is separated from the burial chamber by the massive wooden door and two windows.

	 burial chamber; it is rectangular, with the half-domed brick arch. It was also covered with frescoes which are, unlike the central room, still visible today in the chamber's inner section. They are best preserved on the walls and the ceiling. The frescoes represent a different geometry motifs, combined with the plants and animals in different colors: ochre, cinnabar, blue, green, brown and red. The southern and northern walls have the motifs of fishes and waterfowls while the west has partially recognizable human figures, probably the likes of the buried ones. The chamber contained three built sarcophagi. Part of the arch was collapsed, but was restored later, so as some of the frescoes.

The porch and the central room are partially visible from above the ground, while the chamber is completely embedded into the hill. Later excavations in 1955 showed that the complex wasn't built at the same time. The burial chamber is the oldest while the rest was built later. Today, all the rooms are empty as sarcophagi and sculptures were taken away - some looted long time ago and some disappeared after the tomb was discovered.

It is the first discovered ancient multi-chambered tomb in Belgrade. Characteristics point to the Roman (pagan) sepulchral structure, which probably belonged to the wealthy family which had an estate and a villa in the vicinity, probably of a noble or a military commander. The disposition of the edifice and parts of the sculptures show the connection with the pagan heroons and shrines of the Imperial cult. Considering the tomb's elements and their relations, it marks the link between the Antiquity and early Christian buildings, a progenitor type from which the complex Christian structures of the burial cult developed. Within its period, it shows the connections with other Late Roman monuments, up to 6th century, on the territory of Serbia, but also much wider, on the Balkans and the Middle East. Closest analogy can be found with certain tombs discovered in Syria.

ValtroviÄ‡ described it as one of the "most precious monuments from the Antiquity, not only in Belgrade, but in Serbia". It was protected on 12 February 1948 as the cultural monument of great importance by the Institute for protection of the monuments (Decision No. 200/48), and was declared a cultural heritage of great importance by the state in 1979 (SluÅ¾beni glasnik SocijalistiÄke Republike Srbije, No. 14/79).

#Subtitle level 2: Saint Hermylus and Stratonicus

Roman emperors Constantine I the Great and Licinius signed the Edict of Milan in 313 which made Christianity one of the official religions in the Roman Empire. Licinius, who ruled in the east, soon clashed with Constantine so he outlawed the Christians again. According to the church hagiography from the 5th century, Hermylus, a Christian, was imprisoned and managed to convert one of his guards, Stratonicus. Licinius ordered for both of them to be tortured and drowned, so in the end they were put in one coffin and, still alive, thrown below the Singidunum Fortress at the Sava's mouth into the Danube, in 314 or 315. The coffin was stranded on the shore 18 stadia downstream, allegedly near modern Brestovik. Local Christians buried them in the brick tomb embedded into the hill. They were canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church and their feast day is 26 January.

This prompted clerics and theologians to conclude that the Roman tomb in Brestovik is actually a tomb of Hermylus and Stratonicus. Experts didn't find anything that would point to the Christian tomb. Furthermore, one of two discovered sarcophagi in 1895 was a "female" one, and it was apparently a family tomb for a man, woman and a child. In addition, Brestovik is much further from Belgrade than 18 stadia (c. 3.5 km).

Despite protests from the experts, institutions and the owners of the lot, local clergy and worshipers entered the tomb in 2014, bringing icons, candles and flowers, and holding services, which partially damaged the monument. As the tomb leans on modern cemetery, the church offered to the owners to buy the lot from them so that an entrance directly though the graveyard could be build, but they refused. Supported by several professors from the Faculty of Theology, the church considers the tomb an "early Christian church", that third, unknown person, was also buried with two saints, and that local population removed the remains from the sarcophagi so that advancing Huns or Avars wouldn't desecrate the tomb.

In 2016 local clergy started an initiative to build a church over the tomb. Serbian Orthodox Church again tried to buy the property from the current owners who again refused and the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments stated that the tomb is under protection and that nothing can't be built over it, regardless of the ownership, unless the Institute allows it. Church archaeologists claim that the saints were originally hastily buried in the Grocka's region of DuboÄaj, a bit to the west, and then were reinterred to the new tomb in Brestovik when it was built. They claim that existence of the windows in the chamber prove that it was a room with relics and that one of the faint fresco figures is actually a Virgin Mary with Jesus, with two halos. Archaeologists disputed all this, saying that the image of Virgin Mary with Jesus was not yet used in that period and that absolutely everything discovered in the tomb shows that it is a "classical mausoleum of the high positioned member of an aristocratic family, probably an official or employee in the administration of Singidunum". The municipality of Grocka granted the permit to the Serbian Orthodox Church to build a church in Brestovik, but not on the location of the tomb as they can't do it without the Institute's permission.

However, there are many stories among the local population about other tombs, still undiscovered, embedded into the hills, but no archaeological works have been done other than this locality. The entire area is actually a possible archaeological site with numerous embedded tombs. Only this one was preserved, which doesn't exclude the possibility that there are other, undiscovered ones.

As of July 2016, the Institute was drafting the project of repairing the tomb from the moist damage and conservation of the frescoes in the burial chamber.

#Type: regular article

The Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ  (Ð¡Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ñ€ Ð¡Ð²ÑÑ‚Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð’Ð¾ÑÐºÑ€ÐµÑÑ–Ð½Ð½Ñ ) also called Cathedral of the Resurrection of Our Saviour Is the name given to a historic religious building in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine which functions as a Catholic cathedral and seat of the Ivano-Frankivsk Eparchy (Archieparchia Stanislaopolitanus) using the Byzantine or Ukrainian rite (Greek Catholic) in full communion with the Pope in Rome.

The original church belonged to the Jesuits and was built between 1720 and 1729, but this structure was demolished as a result of technical errors. The present Baroque style church was built between 1752 and 1761 by the ruler of the city, the governor of Poznan and Kiev StanisÅ‚awa Potockiego. Since 1885 it is a greek-Catholic cathedral. It is right next to an old monastery.

The baroque church, has three naves and a facade of two towers. It is under the pastoral responsibility of Archbishop Volodymyr Viytyshyn who was ratified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.

#Article: Louvre castle
#Type: regular article

The Louvre castle was a castle built the by King Philip-Augustus to reinforce the walls he had built around Paris to protect the city. It was demolished steps by steps to make way for the Louvre Palace.

#Subtitle level 2: The fortress

Before his departure for the Third Crusade in 1190, Philip-Augustus wants to protect Paris his capital, especially against English soldiers which were in Normandy. He also wants to have a safe place for his treasure, as well as for his archives that he lost at the Battle of FrÃ©teval in 1194 against Richard the Lionheart and which he had since reconstructed .

He build the enclosure which bears his name, around Paris. From 1190 to 1209 on the right bank, from 1200 to 1215 on the left bank less exposed. The Louvre castle stands on the west, the most exposed side because English soldiers occupy Normandy far from 100 km only. It is also from downstream of the Seine river that came the Norman invasion of 845.

The castle is composed of a approximately square (78 m by 72 m) fortress, surrounded by a moat of about 10 meters wide fed by the water of the nearby Seine rivrer. The wall on the west side, overlooking the countryside and judged the most exposed, is thicker and doorless. The perimeter is reinforced by ten defensive towers, especially at the corners. There are two doors, the main one to the south and the Seine river and a smaller one to the east and the city. They are protected by a drawbridge and framed by two twin towers. Two buildings housing the garrisons and arsenals are placed outside the surrounding wall, to the west and south of the central courtyard. The towers are not far more than 25 m, the distance corresponding to the effective range of a bow. They are pierced with arrowslits to cover the ramparts.

The set of curtains and walls have slightly sloped bases, with the aim of hampering sapping attempts and to facilitate the rebound of projectiles thrown from the summits against attacking soldiers.

In the center of the courtyard is a dungeon named the Grosse Tour (=Big Tower) built in 1200. It is circular 15.6 meters in diameter with a wall thickness of 4.25 meters at its base and a height of 30 meters . It is surrounded by a ditch 9 meters wide and 6 meters deep. This ditch is dry (not flooded), paved with large irregular stones. It is crossed by a drawbridge. The interior volumes are vaulted in stone to limit the risk of fire. The dungeon has a slate conical roof over the machicolation. It has a well and a large tank for supporting a long seat, and also a chapel.

Philippe Auguste had chosen by experience to build a round dungeon and not square or rectangular for military reasons. Indeed, the enemy pioneers could more easily carry out a sapping work on each side of an angle of a square tower than on the wall of a tower of circular plane.

The dungeon had an initially military function (ultimate refuge of the king), but it housed essentially the archives and the royal treasure no doubt until Philippe le Bel. It was also used as a prison until the 14th century. Ferdinand, Count of Flanders defeated and captured at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 was imprisoned here for thirteen years.

The work ends in 1202.

This castle is the main example of the philipian architecture (fr)

#Subtitle level 2: The royal residence

Under the King Louis IX of France, the castle was enlarged, new rooms were built without any real defensive purpose, like the Salle Saint-Louis (1230-1240).

At the time of the King Charles V of France, which reigned from 1364 to 1380, Paris extended widely beyond the walls of Philippe-Auguste. The king built a new enclosure, which encompasses these new quarters, as well as the Louvre castle : The Wall of Charles V. So, the castle lost much of its military interest. Then the King decided to sacrifice some military devices of the castle to make it more habitable as a safe royal residence. Especially after the riot of February 22nd, 1358 led by the Provost of merchants Ã‰tienne Marcel threatening the king inside the Palais de la CitÃ©.

His architect Raymond du Temple adds turrets, statues and habitable surfaces, creates gardens, pierces wider openings. King Charles V builds the First Royal Library by transforming the northwest tower (tower of the Falconry) into a tower of the Librairie which contains nine hundred manuscripts.

The miniatures of the manuscript of the TrÃ¨s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (=Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry) show the castle of the Louvre at that time. They give an idea of the general aspect of the fortress, although at that time aesthetic or comfort arrangements were made to the detriment of military concerns.

During the Hundred Years War, the English soldiers commanded by Henry V of England, allied to the Burgundian mastering of Paris, entered the city on December 1, 1420, and occupied without a fight the Louvre castle. They find the city ruined by civil war and scarcity. They will stay there until 1436.

#Subtitle level 2: A progressive demolition to give place to the Cour CarrÃ©e

In 1525, the King Francis I of France was defeated and made prisonner in Pavia. During his captivity, in Paris, the Court interfered by the use of its right of remonstrance, the faculty of theology and the Parliament of Paris shown some independance. The king held a lit de justice on 24, 26 and 27 July 1526 during which he demonstrated his authority and decided to take over his kingdom by making the Louvre his main residence in Paris. As a symbol of his authority, he orders to demolish the dungeon in 1528 in order to build an Italian palace. In 1546, he entrusts to the architect Pierre Lescot the project of building a modern palace in the spirit of Renaissance architecture with a large hotel particulier and ceremonial rooms. After the death of the king (1547), his son Henry II of France continues work by Pierre Lescot. He destroys the west wall (from December 1546 to March 1549) to build the ballroom, as well as the south wall, to erect the royal pavilion (1553-1556) housing the royal apartments and the small gallery.

After the death of Henry II, his widow Catherine de' Medici continues the development of the south wing for her apartments.

Under Henri III of France, the Louvre becomes the space of monarchical power, a place of entertainment and the theater of historical events (for example the marriage of the future King Henri IV of France with Margaret of Valois which led to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572.

Since 1564, the queen Catherine de' Medici favors the construction of the new Tuileries Palace and the establishment of a large Renaissance garden.Â Henri IV of France destroys the remaining elements on the south side, including the ditch, in order to build the Great Gallery or the Reunion of the Louvre and the Tuileries, completed in 1610. It also begins the construction of the Cour CarrÃ©e (=Square courtyard) on the base of the already built Lescot wing. The surface is multiplied by four compared to the surface of the medieval court. He also destroys some buildings between the two palaces. This project, named le Grand Dessein (=The Large Wish), had also a military function : by establishing a covered walkway between the Louvre and the Tuileries outside the city walls, Henry IV has created a gallery that allows him to flee on horseback in the event of a riot.

In order to establish his power, on April 24th, 1617, the young King Louis XIII of France murdered Concino Concini the favorite of the Queen Anne of Austria his mother in the gate of the castle in the city.

He demolished the northern part of the medieval enclosure in order to extend the Lescot wing in this direction for a search of symmetry. And Louis XIV of France the eastern part to allow the construction of the Perrault's Colonnade.

#Subtitle level 2: The remnants of the medieval Louvre

During the 19th century, it was found that the keep and two of the four walls were only erased and the ditches filled with stones during the destruction of the castle for the construction of the Louvre.

During the construction of the Great Louvre, the bases of the keep and of these two walls were cleared. A major excavation campaign resulted with the discovery of hundreds of objects of everyday life. They are now accessible to the public in a collections named Medieval Louvre. As well as the lower room (now known as the Salle Saint-Louis) and those objects of everyday life found during excavations (small games, jugs, flasks ...)

#Subtitle level 3: Early efforts

Jesuits came to East Timor in 1897 and built Sacred Heart Church in Soibada and ColÃ©gio Nuno Ãlvares, a school for boys, when this was a Portuguese colony; it remains 98.6% Catholic. They left in 1910 when all religious were expelled from Portuguese colonies, and were absent for some decades. Upon returning they ran two minor seminaries, St. Francis Xavier in Dare and Our Lady of FÃ¡tima in Lahane until 2000 when priests of the Catholic Diocese of Dili took these over. They also ran St. Joseph's High School for the Diocese of Dili from 1993 until 2011, when the diocese resumed control of it. Jesuits stood by the people in their independence struggle and two Jesuits were killed in September 1999; they are seen as martyrs, Frs. Tarcisius Dewanto and Karl Albrecht.

#Subtitle level 3: Founding of de Britto

After 2011 the Jesuits turned their attention to opening two of their own schools on a common campus near Kasait, not far from Dili: ColÃ©gio Santo InÃ¡cio de LoiolÃ¡ and teacher education Instituto SÃ£o JoÃ£o de Brito. In 2017 ISIB operated out of classrooms of Loyola in Kasait as construction began there in its own facility.

#Article: Kingdom of Larantuka
#Type: regular article

The Kingdom of Larantuka was a kingdom in present-day East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. It was the one of the few, if not the only, indigenous Roman Catholic polities in the territory of modern Indonesia. Acting as a tributary of the Portuguese Crown, the Raja (King) of Larantuka controlled holdings on the islands of Flores, Solor, Adonara and Lembata. It was later purchased by Dutch East Indies from the Portuguese, prior to its annexation in 1904.

Despite losing its effective sovereignty after the annexation, the Kingdom's royal family persisted as traditional figureheads prior to the final abolishment of the royal structure by republican authorities in 1962.

#Subtitle level 2: History

Monarchs of the Larantuka Kingdom claim descent from an union between a man from the Kingdom of Wehale Waiwuku in South Timor and a mythical woman from a nearby extinct volcano of Ile Mandiri. Traditional belief systems and rituals of the Lamaholot people who were their subjects place the rajas in a central role, especially for those who adhered to traditional beliefs.

In the Javanese Negarakertagama, the locations Galiyao and Solot were mentioned to be "east of Bali" and are believed to correspond to the approximate region, indicating some form of contact from tributary relations or trading between the region and the Majapahit Empire, due to its location in the trade routes carrying sandalwood from nearby Timor. Influences from the powerful Ternate Sultanate were also believed to be present.Western presence in the region started with the Portuguese, who captured Malacca in 1511. As they began trading for the sandalwood at Timor, their presence in the region increased. Solor was described by TomÃ© Pires in his Suma Oriental, although some scholars believe he was referring to nearby larger Flores, mentioning abundance of exported sulphur and foodstuffs. By 1515, there was trade between both Flores and Solor with the foreigners, and by 1520 a small Portuguese settlement has been constructed in Lifau, at Solor. The trade in sandalwood also attracted Chinese and Dutch along with nearer Makassarese, creating competition. The Makassarese attacked and captured Larantuka in 1541 to extend their control over the sandalwood trade and in 1613, the Dutch destroyed the Portuguese base at Solor before establishing themselves at modern Kupang. The first Raja to be baptized was Ola Adobala who was brought up under Portuguese education, traditionally the ninth in the pedigree of the Rajas and baptized during the reign of Peter II of Portugal  while present-day traditional celebrations place his baptism at 1650 instead. In addition, Portuguese sources mention a Dom Constantino between 1625-1661, which implies that Adobala may not be the first in the line of Catholic monarchs of Larantuka. Other monarch names mentioned are Dom Luis (1675) and Dom Domingos Viera (1702) The Dominican Order was vital in the spread of Catholicism in the area until their later replacement in the 19th century.

The polity maintained some form of a closed-port policy for outsiders in the late 17th century. There were also some interactions with nearby Islam Bima Sultanate, whose Sultan enforced his suzerainty over parts of Western Flores in 1685. Territories of the kingdom were not contiguous, and was interspersed by the holdings of several lesser polities. Some Muslim.

By 1851, debts incurred by the Portuguese colony in East Timor motivated the Portuguese authorities to "sell" territories covered by Larantuka to the Dutch East Indies, and the transfer was made by 1859 ceding the Portuguese claim/suzerainty over parts of Flores and the island range stretching from Alor to Solor for 200,000 florins and some Dutch holdings in Timor. The treaty also confirmed that the Catholic inhabitants of the region will remain so under the authority of Protestant Netherlands, and the Dutch authorities sent Jesuit priests to the area.

On 14 September 1887 a new Raja Don Lorenzo Diaz Vieria Godinho ascended to the throne as Lorenzo II, who was educated by Jesuit priests. Showing clear traits of independence, he attempted to extract taxes from territories belonging to a nearby Raja of Sikka, led groups of men to intervene in local conflicts, and refused to conduct sacrifices in the manner his predecessors did for the non-Catholic natives. Eventually, colonial authorities responded by deposing and exiling him to Java on 1904, where he died six years later.

The royal family remained post-Indonesian independence as traditional figureheads with no legal authority, until their final abolishment on 1962.

#Subtitle level 2: Legacy

In present-day Indonenesia, unique Catholic traditions close to Easter days remain, locally known as the Semana Santa. It involves a procession carrying statues of Jesus and Virgin Mary (locally referred to as Tuan Ana and Tuan Ma) to a local beach, then to Cathedral of the Queen of the Rosary, seat of the bishop. The raja title is still held by descendants of the past kings (most recently by Don Andre III Marthinus DVG on 2016), although it is not associated with any secular authority. The residence (istana) of the king still stands to this day.

According to the 2010 census, the majority of the population in the kingdom's former territories, and the East Nusa Tenggara province as a whole, remained Catholics.

#Article: Monastery Agios Dionysios
#Type: regular article

The two monasteries named Agios Dionysios (Greek Î‘Î³Î¹ÏŒÏ‚ Î”Î¹Î¿Î½ÏÏƒÎ¹Î¿Ï‚) are located in Greece at Mount Olympos.

#Subtitle level 2: Location

The older of the two monasteries is located at the Enipeas ravine at an altitude of 850 m. The newer monastery is about three kilometers outside of Litochoro.

#Subtitle level 2: Name

Originally the name of the ancient monastery was Agia Triada, Holy Trinity, (Greek Î‘Î³Î¯Î± Î¤ÏÎ¹Î¬Î´Î±). In the course of time, however, the name of its founder, Saint Dionysius, has prevailed. The new monastery was named directly after Saint Dionysius.

#Subtitle level 2: History (old and new monastery)

In 1542 it was founded by Saint Dionysius and devoted to the Holy Trinity. Surrounded by strong high walls and towered by a watchtower, it resembles a small fortress. During various conflicts it served as a shelter for civilians, but also for fighting troops. Today the visitor can see a ruin from the outside. In its history the monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. In 1821 Veli Pasha burnt it down. The last destructive blow, however, brought him the German Wehrmacht in April 1943. Since Greek freedom fighters should have retreated in the monastery, it was first bombed and later blasted.

The monks then left the destroyed monastery and moved into the Metochion, the estate of the monastery. The Metochion was founded in 1650 and consisted, apart from the lands, of a church, the economic buildings and another building in which the monks lived, who took care of the farm. After the Second World War, this estate was gradually expanded into a monastery. The older part of the new monastery is equipped with a heavy iron door and thus separated from the rest of the system. Access to this area, called Abaton, is only permitted for men. Here you will find the old church, the cells of the monks, the refectory and the administrative building. Just outside are the stables, workshops and the cheese factory. All other buildings, outside the Abaton, such as the new church or the museum, were built after 1985.

The Agios Dionysios Monastery is a stauropegic monastery, subordinated directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople (Istanbul).

#Subtitle level 2: The church

It was built in classical orthodox style. An image of Saint Dionysius adorns the entrance. Inside, in addition to the usual sumptuous decor of an Orthodox church, there are some special features. It is striking that many chairs, standing consoles and other items are decorated with marquetry. The inserts are made of ivory or mother-of-pearl. On a small table stands an icon depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Next to it is a little basket with notes and ball-point pens. Believers who want to make a request to the saint can put it here on paper.

#Subtitle level 2: The museum (New monastery)

To the west of the complex is the museum. In troubled times, of which the old monastery lived some, monks were hiding the monastic treasures in secret vaults. A selection of rescued exhibits:

	 Three silver skulls, into which bone pieces of saints were worked, are exhibited together with other relics.

	 Old documents, including the document from the year 949 of the Islamic calendar (1542 AD), in which the Ottoman occupiers allow the repair (in fact probably the foundation) of a monastery on Mount Olympus.

	 Through a magnifying glass one can admire the finest wood carvings within a metal cross.

	 A epitaph, embroidered with gold threads, made in the years 1578 and -79 by Arsenius, a monk of the Meteora Monasteries.

	 Some of the rescued icons of the old monastery.

Quite inconspicuous, but significant, some framed black-and-white photographs hang near the entrance. They show the old monastery in the mountains just before its destruction. A soldier of the Wehrmacht made these pictures secretly and sent them to the monastery a few years ago.

#Subtitle level 2: The chapel of Saint Dionysios

Twenty minutes' walk from the old monastery is the chapel of Saint Dionysius. It is located at the Enipeas River in a southeastern direction from the monastery. Who from Litochoro ascends to Prionia comes necessarily by the chapel. It is built under an overhanging rock, just above a spring. It consists of a small devotional space where the saint celebrated the sacred liturgy during his time as a hermit. A small shed served him as a sleeping place.
